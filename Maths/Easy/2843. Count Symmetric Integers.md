## Problem statement:
You are given two positive integers `low` and `high`.

An integer `x` consisting of `2 * n` digits is symmetric if the sum of the first `n` digits of `x` is equal to the sum of the last `n` digits of `x`. Numbers with an odd number of digits are never symmetric.

Return the number of symmetric integers in the range `[low, high]`.




## Example 1:

```
Input: low = 1, high = 100

Output: 9

Explanation: There are 9 symmetric integers between 1 and 100: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: low = 1200, high = 1230

Output: 4

Explanation: There are 4 symmetric integers between 1200 and 1230: 1203, 1212, 1221, and 1230.
```





## Constraints:

```
1 <= low <= high <= 104
```


 

## Approach:

1. Initialize a counter variable `symmetricDigitsBetweenRange` to keep track of the count of symmetric integers found within the given range.

2. Iterate through the integers in the inclusive range from `low` to `high`.

3. For each integer `i` in this range, use the `isSymmetric` method to check if it is symmetric.

4. The `isSymmetric` method converts the integer to a string to work with its digits.
   - It checks if the length of the string is 1 or odd because such numbers cannot be symmetric.
   - If the number passes this initial check, it calculates the sum of digits in the first and second halves of the number string.
   - If the sums of the first and second halves are equal, it means the number is symmetric, and the counter is incremented.

5. Continue this process for all integers in the given range.

6. Finally, return the value of `symmetricDigitsBetweenRange`, which represents the count of symmetric integers found in the range.

### Example:
Let's say we want to count symmetric integers between `low = 10` and `high = 50`. We'll walk through the steps:
- Initialize `symmetricDigitsBetweenRange` to 0.
- Start iterating through integers from 10 to 50.
- For each integer `i` in this range:
  - Convert `i` to a string.
  - Check if the length of the string is 1 or odd (which is not the case for 10-50).
  - Calculate the sum of the first half and the second half of the number string.
  - If the sums are equal, increment `symmetricDigitsBetweenRange`.
- After the loop, return the value of `symmetricDigitsBetweenRange`, which will be the count of symmetric integers found.

In this example, the code would return a count of symmetric integers between 10 and 50, which might be, for instance, 5 (if we find numbers like 22, 33, 44, etc., within this range).

## Code: 

```java
public int countSymmetricIntegers(int low, int high) {
    int symmetricDigitsBetweenRange = 0;

    // Loop through the range of integers from 'low' to 'high' (inclusive).
    for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) {
        // Check if the current number 'i' is symmetric using the 'isSymmetric' method.
        if (isSymmetric(i)) {
            // If 'i' is symmetric, increment the counter for symmetric digits.
            symmetricDigitsBetweenRange += 1;
        }
    }
    // Return the total count of symmetric integers found in the range.
    return symmetricDigitsBetweenRange;
}

private boolean isSymmetric(int number) {
    // Convert the integer 'number' to a string to work with its digits.
    String numberStr = Integer.toString(number);
    int length = numberStr.length();

    // Check if the length of the number is 1 or odd; these numbers cannot be symmetric.
    if (length == 1 || length % 2 != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    int firstHalfSum = 0;
    int secondHalfSum = 0;

    // Calculate the sum of digits in the first and second halves of the number string.
    for (int i = 0; i < length / 2; i++) {
        firstHalfSum += Character.getNumericValue(numberStr.charAt(i));
        secondHalfSum += Character.getNumericValue(numberStr.charAt(length / 2 + i));
    }

    // Check if the sums of the first and second halves are equal.
    return firstHalfSum == secondHalfSum;
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O( ((high-low)+1)*Str(N) )
Space complexity:O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- How to get numeric value from char , (length / 2 + i) in one loop getting second half sum as well
