## Problem statement:
You are given a `0-indexed` string `num` representing a non-negative integer.

In one operation, you can pick any digit of `num` and delete it. Note that if you delete all the digits of `num`, `num` becomes `0`.

Return the `minimum number of operations` required to make num special.

An integer x is considered special if it is divisible by `25`.
