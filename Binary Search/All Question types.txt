Binary Search
-----------------------------------------------------------
704. Binary Search -> How to implement Binary Search

33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array ⭐ -> The way  binary Search is  modified , the logic of that every part will sorted [Left or Right] then checking moving accordling ,and which portion to elminate from the search space

81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II ⭐ -> That nums[start] <= nums[mid] works for it and its part 1 condition and skip only when nums[start]== nums[mid] ==nums[end] , dealing with duplicates

540. Single Element in a Sorted Array ⭐⭐ -> Figuraing out the elimation by the index (even odd , odd even) main thing the question , condition for rather than writing mutiple condition writing single to check

744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target ⭐⭐ -> Thinking of ASCII values in place of letters in the brain , binary saerch applied to characters 

 




Upper / Lower / Floor / Ceil
-----------------------------------------------------------
35. Search Insert Position ⭐ -> That is lower bound question ,And this is Binary Search Question

34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array ⭐ -> That this problem can be solved using lower & upper bound trick as well as binary search

2089. Find Target Indices After Sorting Array -> This question optimal way is counting sort way , But using Binary Search way is upper & lower bound


Peak 
-----------------------------------------------------------
162. Find Peak Element ⭐ ->  How solved increaing decreasing type of question in binary search

852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array ⭐ -> Array will have a peak always ,this question 1 peak question if u read it carefully




Binary Search on Answer
-----------------------------------------------------------
69. Sqrt(x) ⭐ ->  When a range is given and we have search apply binary search on answers concept

278. First Bad Version ⭐ -> Optimal way to call api , That configuring out this is a binary search question

374. Guess Number Higher or Lower -> Binary Search on answer variant question

367. Valid Perfect Square -> Nothing much

875. Koko Eating Bananas ⭐⭐ -> That this is binary search question which does not look that way , binary search can have more than logN time , Determining the range is given indirectly

1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets ⭐⭐ ->  That this is binary search on answer question , figuring out the range which is hidden , and thinking the adjacent function code ,and knowing  adjacent function should be boolean way rather getting the total value from  it as think when all element are smaller than that midvalue and that is min value it itself what will happen it will return a integer value but than a answer , boolean way works

1283. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold ⭐⭐ -> isPossible code logic nad maths related to it

441. Arranging Coins ⭐ -> How to use long rather in when values becomes too large (like mid*mid) when multiplying and Maths (sum of till  number nth)

1539. Kth Missing Positive Number ⭐⭐⭐ -> Every thing in this question is super importany , from forming the formula to knowning and applying Binary Search

1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days ⭐⭐ -> Not Using possible method can but  i am not, calucalting start being max value (better for optimzition) , not using possible method way as mine code not working on that one , knowing findDays how to code it


Binary Search on Answer (Min or Max / Max or Min)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Aggressive Cows ⭐⭐ -> How to code the helper function which seems easy than expected , Range from 1 to max-min(observation) which is important for best code

1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls ⭐⭐ -> Sorting being Used then Binary Search ,The extra function apart from binary Search / helper function how to code

Allocate minimum number of pages ⭐⭐ ->  How to code the helper function , Getting optimal start and end values , not using possble methods





Binary Search on Matrix
-----------------------------------------------------------
74. Search a 2D Matrix ⭐⭐ -> To solve this You Have to think this matrix in 1D form , converting 1D mid values to 2D values formula( int row = mid/numCols | int col = mid%numCols )
