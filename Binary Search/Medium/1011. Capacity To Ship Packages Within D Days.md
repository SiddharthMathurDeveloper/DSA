<h1 align="center"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/" target="_blank">1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days</a></h1>

## Problem statement:
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days `days`.

The `ith` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). 
We may not load more weight than the maximum `weight` capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days` days.


## Example 1:

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5

Output: 15

Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3

Output: 6

Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= days <= weights.length <= 5 * 10^4

1 <= weights[i] <= 500
```


 

## Approach:

## Code: 

```java
public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {
    // Find the maximum and the summation:
    int start = Integer.MIN_VALUE, end = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
        end += weights[i];
        start = Math.max(start, weights[i]);
    }

    int ans = -1; // Initialize the answer to -1

    while (start <= end) { // Perform binary search until start is less than or equal to end
        int mid = (start + end) / 2; // Calculate the middle capacity

        int numberOfDays = findDays(weights, mid); // Calculate the number of days required for capacity mid

        if (numberOfDays <= days) {
            ans = mid; // If mid capacity allows shipping within days, update the answer
            end = mid - 1; // Move to the left half of the search range
        } else {
            // Eliminate the left half, as mid capacity is insufficient for the given days
            start = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans; // Return the minimum required capacity
}

public static int findDays(int[] weights, int cap) {
    int days = 1; // Initialize the number of days to 1 (first day)
    int load = 0; // Initialize the current load to 0
    int n = weights.length; // Get the size of the weights array

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (load + weights[i] > cap) {
            days += 1; // Move to the next day as the current load exceeds the capacity
            load = weights[i]; // Load the weight on the new day
        } else {
            // Load the weight on the same day without exceeding the capacity
            load += weights[i];
        }
    }
    return days; // Return the total number of days required for the given capacity
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N * log(sum(weights[]) â€“ max(weights[]) + 1))
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- Not Using possible , calucalting start being max value (better for optimzition) , not using possible method way as mine code not working on that one , knowing the findDays how to code it
