## Problem statement:
You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`.

You want to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` adjacent flowers from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `ith` flower will bloom in the `bloomDay[i]` and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.

Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return `-1`.




## Example 1:

```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation: Let us see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower did not bloom in the garden.
We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.
After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.
After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.
After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2

Output: -1

Explanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3

Output: 12

Explanation: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.
Here is the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.
After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.
```


## Constraints:

```
bloomDay.length == n

1 <= n <= 10^5

1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9

1 <= m <= 10^6

1 <= k <= n
```


 

## Approach (Binary Search on Answer):

1. **Initialize Search Range:**

    - Initialize `start` as 1 and `end` as the maximum element in the `bloomDay` array.

    - If the total number of flowers available (`n`) is less than the required number of flowers (`m * k`), it's impossible to form `m` bouquets. So, return -1.

2. **Binary Search Approach:**

    - Perform binary search to find the minimum number of days required to form `m` bouquets:

        - Calculate `mid` as the middle value between `start` and `end`.

        - Check if it's possible to form `m` bouquets with `k` flowers each on the `mid` day using the `bouquetPossibleDay` function.

        - If it's possible, update `ans` with `mid` and search for an earlier day by setting `end = mid - 1`.

        - If it's not possible, search for a later day by setting `start = mid + 1`.

3. **bouquetPossibleDay Function:**

    - Initialize `counterBouquet` and `total` to keep track of bouquets formed.

    - Loop through the `bloomDay` array:
        - If the current flower blooms on or before the given day (`MaxDayToPick`), increment `counterBouquet`.
        - Otherwise, calculate the bouquets formed using `counterBouquet / k` and add it to `total`.
        - Reset `counterBouquet` to 0.

    - Calculate the remaining bouquets that can be formed using `counterBouquet / k` and add it to `total`.

    - Return `true` if `total` is greater than or equal to `m`, indicating that the required bouquets can be formed on the given day.

By using binary search, we are efficiently narrowing down the search range for the minimum number of days required to form `m` bouquets.

## Example:

Let's consider an example:

Input: `bloomDay = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2], m = 3, k = 1`

- Initialize `start` = 1 and `end` = 10.

- Total flowers available `n` = 5, required flowers `m * k` = 3 * 1 = 3.

- Calculate `mid` = (1 + 10) / 2 = 5.

- Check if it's possible to form 3 bouquets with 1 flower each on day 5 using `bouquetPossibleDay` function. It's possible, so update `ans` with `mid` = 5 and search for an earlier day.

- Calculate `mid` = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3.

- Check if it's possible to form 3 bouquets with 1 flower each on day 3. It's not possible, so search for a later day.

- Calculate `mid` = (3 + 5) / 2 = 4.

- Check if it's possible to form 3 bouquets with 1 flower each on day 4. It's possible, so update `ans` with `mid` = 4 and search for an earlier day.

- Calculate `mid` = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.

- Check if it's possible to form 3 bouquets with 1 flower each on day 3. It's not possible, so search for a later day.

- Calculate `mid` = (4 + 4) / 2 = 4.

- Check if it's possible to form 3 bouquets with 1 flower each on day 4. It's possible, so update `ans` with `mid` = 4 and search for an earlier day.

- The binary search loop completes, and the minimum number of days required to make 3 bouquets is 4.

The answer is 4 days.




## Code: 

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDays(int[] bloomDay, int m, int k) {
        int start = 1;
        int end = maxElementInArray(bloomDay);

        int ans = -1;
        if (m * k > bloomDay.length) {
            return ans; // Not enough flowers to form the required bouquets
        }

        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            boolean bouquetFormed = bouquetPossibleDay(bloomDay, m, k, mid);

            if (bouquetFormed) {
                ans = mid; // Update the answer if a bouquet can be formed on this day
                end = mid - 1; // Search for earlier days to form bouquets
            } else {
                start = mid + 1; // Bouquet not possible on this day, search for later days
            }
        }
        return ans; // Return the minimum day required to form bouquets
    }

    // Function to find the maximum element in an array
    public int maxElementInArray(int[] nums) {
        int maxElement = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        int numsLength = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < numsLength; i++) {
            maxElement = Math.max(maxElement, nums[i]);
        }

        return maxElement;
    }

    // Function to check if it's possible to form m bouquets each with k flowers on a given day
    public boolean bouquetPossibleDay(int[] bloomDay, int m, int k, int MaxDayToPick) {
        int counterBouquet = 0;
        int total = 0;

        int bloomDayLength = bloomDay.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < bloomDayLength; i++) {
            if (bloomDay[i] <= MaxDayToPick) {
                counterBouquet++; // Increment the counter for flowers that can be picked
            } else {
                total += (counterBouquet / k); // Calculate the bouquets formed using k flowers
                counterBouquet = 0; // Reset the counter
            }
        }
        total += (counterBouquet / k); // Calculate the remaining bouquets
        
        return total >= m; // Check if the required bouquets are formed
    }
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(log(max(arr) * N)
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- That this is binary search on answer question , figuring out the range which is hidden , and thinking the adjacent function code ,
  and knowing  adjacent function should be boolean way rather getting the total value from it as think when all element are smaller than that mid
  value and that is min value it itself what will happen it will return a integer value but than a answer , boolean way works
