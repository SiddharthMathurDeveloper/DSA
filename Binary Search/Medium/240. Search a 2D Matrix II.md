## Problem statement:
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

## Example 1:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5

Output: true
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20

Output: false
```



## Constraints:

```
m == matrix.length

n == matrix[i].length

1 <= n, m <= 300

-10^9 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^9

All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.

All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.

-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
```


 

## Approach:


## Matrix Dimensions
- First, determine the number of rows (n) and columns (m) in the given 2D matrix.

## Starting Point
- Initialize two pointers, row and col, to navigate through the matrix. Start from the top-right corner of the matrix, i.e., row = 0 and col = m - 1.

## Search Loop
- Enter a loop that continues until row is within the range [0, n-1] and col is within the range [0, m-1]. This loop will search for the target in the matrix.

## Comparison with Target
- Check if the element at matrix position (row, col) is equal to the target.
  - If they are equal, the target is found in the matrix, so return true.
  - If the matrix element is less than the target, increment row to move to the next row.
  - If the matrix element is greater than the target, decrement col to move to the previous column.

## Repeat Search
- Continue the search loop until row goes beyond the last row or col goes before the first column.

## Target Not Found
- If the target is not found after the search loop, return false.

## Example

Consider the following sorted 2D matrix:

matrix = [ [1, 4, 7], [10, 11, 16], [23, 30, 34] ]


Let's say we want to search for target = 10 using the `searchMatrix` function.

- Initially, n = 3 (number of rows) and m = 3 (number of columns).
- We start at the top-right corner: row = 0 and col = 2.

In the example:
- In the first step, we compare matrix[0][2] (element 7) with the target 10. Since 7 is less than 10, we increment row to 1.
- In the second step, we compare matrix[1][2] (element 16) with the target 10. Since 16 is greater than 10, we decrement col to 1.
- In the third step, we compare matrix[1][1] (element 11) with the target 10. Since 11 is greater than 10, we decrement col to 0.
- In the fourth step, we compare matrix[1][0] (element 10) with the target 10. They match, so we return true since the target is found in the matrix.

The function returns true because the target value 10 is present in the matrix.



## Code: 

```java
public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
    int n = matrix.length;          // Number of rows in the matrix
    int m = matrix[0].length;       // Number of columns in the matrix
    
    int row = 0;                    // Initialize row to the first row (top)
    int col = m - 1;                // Initialize col to the last column (rightmost)

    // Start searching from the top-right corner and move within the matrix.
    while (row < n && col >= 0) {
        int currentElement = matrix[row][col];  // Get the element at the current position
        
        // Check if the current element is equal to the target.
        if (currentElement == target) {
            return true;  // Target found in the matrix, so return true.
        } else if (currentElement < target) {
            // If the current element is less than the target, move down to the next row.
            row++;
        } else {
            // If the current element is greater than the target, move left to the previous column.
            col--;
        }
    }

    // If the loop exits without finding the target, it means the target is not in the matrix.
    return false;  // Target not found in the matrix, so return false.
}
```

- That sometime binary may not be in the form we expect it to be in Binary Search is all about elimation ,
