<h1 align="center"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/" target="_blank">Question</a></h1>

## Problem statement:
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer `target`, return `true` if `target` is in `matrix` or `false` otherwise.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.


## Example 1:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3

Output: true
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13

Output: false
```



## Constraints:

```

m == matrix.length

n == matrix[i].length

1 <= m, n <= 100

-10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4
```


 

## Approach:

### Binary Search Initialization

Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, for binary search. `start` points to the beginning of the flattened matrix, which is the first element, and `end` points to the end of the flattened matrix, which is the last element. The flattened matrix is treated as a 1D array with a length of `numRows * numCols`.

### Binary Search

Perform binary search while `start` is less than or equal to `end`.

### Midpoint Calculation

Calculate the midpoint `mid` as `(start + end) / 2`.

### Convert to Matrix Indices

Calculate the corresponding row (`row`) and column (`col`) indices in the original 2D matrix for the midpoint `mid`. This is done using integer division (`mid / numCols`) for the row and modulo (`mid % numCols`) for the column.

### Comparison with Target

- Check if the element at matrix position `(row, col)` is equal to the target.
  
  - If they are equal, the target is found in the matrix, so return `true`.
  
  - If the matrix element is greater than the target, adjust `end` to search in the left half.
  
  - If the matrix element is less than the target, adjust `start` to search in the right half.

### Repeat Binary Search

Continue the binary search until `start` is greater than `end` (search space is exhausted).

### Target Not Found

If the target is not found after the binary search, return `false`.


# Example


### Initial Setup

- Initially, `numRows = 3` and `numCols = 3`.
- matrix = [
[1, 4, 7],
[10, 11, 16],
[23, 30, 34]
]
- The flattened matrix has `start = 0` and `end = 8` (from index 0 to index 8).

### Binary Search Iterations

### First Iteration

- `mid = (0 + 8) / 2 = 4`.
- Corresponding matrix indices are `(row = 1, col = 1)`.
- The element `matrix[1][1]` is 11, which is greater than the target 10.
- So, adjust `end` to `mid - 1 = 3` to search in the left half.

### Second Iteration

- `mid = (0 + 3) / 2 = 1`.
- Corresponding matrix indices are `(row = 0, col = 1)`.
- The element `matrix[0][1]` is 4, which is less than the target 10.
- So, adjust `start` to `mid + 1 = 2` to search in the right half.

### Third Iteration

- `mid = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2`.
- Corresponding matrix indices are `(row = 0, col = 2)`.
- The element `matrix[0][2]` is 7, which is less than the target 10.
- So, adjust `start` to `mid + 1 = 3` to search in the right half.

### Fourth Iteration

- `mid = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3`.
- Corresponding matrix indices are `(row = 1, col = 0)`.
- The element `matrix[1][0]` is 10, which matches the target 10.
- Return `true` since the target is found in the matrix.

The function returns `true` in this case because the target value 10 is present in the matrix.

















## Code: 

```java
public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
    int numRows = matrix.length;        // Get the number of rows in the matrix.
    int numCols = matrix[0].length;     // Get the number of columns in the matrix.

    int start = 0;                     // Initialize the start index for binary search.
    int end = numRows * numCols - 1;   // Initialize the end index for binary search.

    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;  // Calculate the middle index.

        int row = mid / numCols;      // Calculate the row index of the middle element.
        int col = mid % numCols;      // Calculate the column index of the middle element.

        if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
            // If the middle element is equal to the target, return true.
            return true;
        }

        if (matrix[row][col] > target) {
            // If the middle element is greater than the target, search in the left half.
            end = mid - 1;
        } else {
            // If the middle element is less than the target, search in the right half.
            start = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return false;  // If the target value is not found, return false.
}
```



## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(log(m * n)) 
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- To solve this You Have to think this matrix in 1D form , converting 1D mid values to 2D values formula( int row = mid/numCols | int col = mid%numCols )
