## Problem statement:
There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` `(1 <= k < nums.length)` such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of target if it is in nums, or `-1` if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0

Output: 4
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3

Output: -1
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0

Output: -1
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
All values of nums are unique.
nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
-10^4 <= target <= 10^4
```


 

## Approach :

# Modified Binary Search Approach.

1. Initialize `start` to the index 0 and `end` to the index `nums.length - 1`.
2. While `start` is less than or equal to `end`, repeat the following steps:
   - Calculate the middle index as `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is equal to `target`, return `mid` as the index where the target is found.
   - Check whether the left part of the array (`nums[start]` to `nums[mid]`) is sorted. If it is sorted, perform the following sub-steps:
     - Check if the target lies within the sorted left part. If yes, adjust `end` to `mid - 1` to search in the left part. Otherwise, adjust `start` to `mid + 1` to search in the right part.
   - If the left part is not sorted, it means the right part (`nums[mid]` to `nums[end]`) is sorted. Perform the following sub-steps:
     - Check if the target lies within the sorted right part. If yes, adjust `start` to `mid + 1` to search in the right part. Otherwise, adjust `end` to `mid - 1` to search in the left part.
   - If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the target is not present in the array.

## Example:

Let's consider an example to understand how the approach works:

Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 0

1. Initial `start` = 0 and `end` = 6.
2. Calculate `mid` = 0 + (6 - 0) / 2 = 3.
   - `nums[mid]` = `nums[3]` = 7, which is greater than the target 0. The left part [4, 5, 6, 7] is sorted.
   - Check if the target 0 lies within the sorted left part. Yes, it does. Adjust `end` = `mid - 1` = 2 to search in the left part.
3. Calculate `mid` = 0 + (2 - 0) / 2 = 1.
   - `nums[mid]` = `nums[1]` = 5, which is greater than the target 0. The left part [4, 5] is sorted.
   - Check if the target 0 lies within the sorted left part. Yes, it does. Adjust `end` = `mid - 1` = 0 to search in the left part.
4. Calculate `mid` = 0 + (0 - 0) / 2 = 0.
   - `nums[mid]` = `nums[0]` = 4, which is greater than the target 0. The left part [4] is sorted.
   - Check if the target 0 lies within the sorted left part. No, it doesn't. Adjust `start` = `mid + 1` = 1 to search in the right part.
5. Calculate `mid` = 1 + (0 - 1) / 2 = 0.
   - `nums[mid]` = `nums[0]` = 4, which is greater than the target 0. The left part [4] is sorted.
   - Check if the target 0 lies within the sorted left part. No, it doesn't. Adjust `start` = `mid + 1` = 1 to search in the right part.
6. Calculate `mid` = 1 + (0 - 1) / 2 = 0.
   - `nums[mid]` = `nums[0]` = 4, which is greater than the target 0. The left part [4] is sorted.
   - Check if the target 0 lies within the sorted left part. No, it doesn't. Adjust `start` = `mid + 1` = 1 to search in the right part.
7. Since `start` becomes greater than `end`, the loop exits.
8. Return -1 since the target 0 is not found in the array.

In this example, the target 0 is not found in the rotated sorted array, so the algorithm returns -1.






## Code: 

```java
 public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;

        // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid; // If target is found, return the index
            }

            // Check if the left part of the array is sorted
            if (nums[start] <= nums[mid]) {
                // If target lies within the sorted left part
                if (nums[start] <= target && nums[mid] >= target) {
                    end = mid - 1; // Adjust end index to search left part
                } else {
                    start = mid + 1; // Adjust start index to search right part
                }
            }
            
            // Check if the right part of the array is sorted
            else {
                // If target lies within the sorted right part
                if (nums[end] >= target && nums[mid] <= target) {
                    start = mid + 1; // Adjust start index to search right part
                } else {
                    end = mid - 1; // Adjust end index to search left part
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // If target is not found, return -1
    }
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(Log(N))
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- The way  binary Search is  modified , the logic of that every part will sorted [Left or Right] then checking moving accordling ,and which portion to elminate from the search space
