## Problem statement:
Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`.

Return the `kth` positive integer that is missing from this array.




## Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5

Output: 9

Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= arr.length <= 1000

1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

1 <= k <= 1000

arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length
```

## Code: 

```java
public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        int start = 0;                    // Initialize the start index for binary search
        int end = arr.length - 1;         // Initialize the end index for binary search

        // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;    // Calculate the middle index

            int missingValue = arr[mid] - (mid + 1); // Calculate the number of missing values before the mid element

            // If the number of missing values before the mid element is less than k,
            // move the start index to the right to search for higher missing values
            if (missingValue < k) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1; // Otherwise, move the end index to the left to search for lower missing values
            }
        }

        // At the end of binary search, kth missing value will be k positions ahead of the last checked index
        // Adding k to end + 1 gives us the kth missing value
        return k + end + 1;
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(logN)
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- Every thing in this question is super importany  , from forming the formula to knowning and applying Binary Search
