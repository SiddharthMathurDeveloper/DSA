## Problem statement:
Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`.

Return the `kth` positive integer that is missing from this array.




## Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5

Output: 9

Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= arr.length <= 1000

1 <= arr[i] <= 1000

1 <= k <= 1000

arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length
```


 

## Approach:

1. **Initialize Binary Search Range:**

    Initialize `start` and `end` indices for binary search within the array `arr`. `start` will be set to `0`, and `end` will be set to `arr.length - 1`.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**

    Perform a binary search until the `start` index is less than or equal to the `end` index. Perform the following steps in each iteration:

    - Calculate the middle index as `mid` using `(start + end) / 2`.

    - Calculate the number of missing positive integers that should have appeared before the element at the `mid` index. This can be calculated by subtracting the index `(mid + 1)` from the value at the `mid` index (`arr[mid]`). Store this value in `missingValue`.

    - Compare `missingValue` with `k`:

        - If `missingValue` is less than `k`, it means that the `kth` missing positive integer must appear after the element at the `mid` index. In this case, update the `start` index to `mid + 1`.

        - If `missingValue` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means that the `kth` missing positive integer must appear before or at the element at the `mid` index. In this case, update the `end` index to `mid - 1`.

3. **Binary Search Completion:**

    Repeat steps 2 until the `start` index becomes greater than the `end` index. This indicates that the binary search has converged, and the `kth` missing positive integer is found.

4. **Calculate and Return the Result:**

    The `kth` missing positive integer will be `k` positions ahead of the last checked index. Add `k` to the value of `end + 1` to get the `kth` missing positive integer.

    Return the calculated `kth` missing positive integer as the result.


## EXAMPLE :
arr = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5

Initial start = 0, end = 4

- Mid = (0 + 4) / 2 = 2
- Missing value at mid = arr[2] - (2 + 1) = 4 - 3 = 1

Since 1 < 5, move start to mid + 1

Updated start = 3, end = 4

- Mid = (3 + 4) / 2 = 3
- Missing value at mid = arr[3] - (3 + 1) = 7 - 4 = 3

Since 3 < 5, move start to mid + 1

Updated start = 4, end = 4

- Mid = (4 + 4) / 2 = 4
- Missing value at mid = arr[4] - (4 + 1) = 11 - 5 = 6

Since 6 >= 5, move end to mid - 1

Updated start = 4, end = 3

Binary search converged, kth missing positive integer = k + end + 1 = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9

Result = 9



## Code: 

```java
public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        int start = 0;                    // Initialize the start index for binary search
        int end = arr.length - 1;         // Initialize the end index for binary search

        // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;    // Calculate the middle index

            int missingValue = arr[mid] - (mid + 1); // Calculate the number of missing values before the mid element

            // If the number of missing values before the mid element is less than k,
            // move the start index to the right to search for higher missing values
            if (missingValue < k) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1; // Otherwise, move the end index to the left to search for lower missing values
            }
        }

        // At the end of binary search, kth missing value will be k positions ahead of the last checked index
        // Adding k to end + 1 gives us the kth missing value
        return k + end + 1;
}
```
