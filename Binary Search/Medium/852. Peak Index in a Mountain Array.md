## Problem statement:
An array `arr` is a mountain if the following properties hold:

`arr.length >= 3`
There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
`arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]` 
`arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`
Given a mountain array `arr`, return the index i such that `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`.

You must solve it in `O(log(arr.length))` time complexity.




## Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [0,1,0]

Output: 1
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]

Output: 1
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]

Output: 1
```


## Constraints:

```
3 <= arr.length <= 10^5


0 <= arr[i] <= 10^6

arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.
```


 

## Approach:

***Initialize the search range:***

- Start by initializing the start index as 1 and the end index as arrLength - 2, where arrLength is the length of the array. This range excludes the first and last elements since they cannot be peak elements due to their neighbors.
***Binary search loop:***

- Use a while loop to perform binary search within the search range (from start to end).
***Calculate the middle index:***

- Calculate the middle index mid using the formula mid = start + (end - start) / 2.
***Check conditions:***

- Check if the element at index mid is a peak element. For an element to be a peak, it must be greater than both its neighbors: arr[mid - 1] and arr[mid + 1].
If the condition is met, return mid as the index of the peak element.
***Adjust the search range:***

- If the element at index mid is increasing (greater than its previous element arr[mid - 1]), it means the peak element is on the right side. Update start = mid + 1 to search in the right half.
If the element at index mid is decreasing (less than its previous element arr[mid - 1]), it means the peak element is on the left side. Update end = mid - 1 to search in the left half.
***Repeat the loop:***

- Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the start index is less than or equal to the end index.
***Return the result:***

- If a peak element is not found within the given search range, return -1 as the result to indicate that no peak element was found.


## Code: 

```java
public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
    int arrLength = arr.length;

    // Base case: If the array length is 3, it's guaranteed to be a mountain array
    // and the peak will be at index 1.
    if (arrLength == 3) {
        return 1;
    }

    int start = 1; // Start index of the search range
    int end = arrLength - 2; // End index of the search range

    int peakIndex = -1; // Initialize the peak index

    // Perform binary search to find the peak element
    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; // Calculate the middle index

        // Check if the element at index mid is a peak element
        if (arr[mid - 1] < arr[mid] && arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]) {
            peakIndex = mid; // Update the peak index
            return peakIndex; // Return the peak index
        }

        // If the element at index mid is increasing, move to the right half
        else if (arr[mid] > arr[mid - 1]) {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
        // If the element at index mid is decreasing, move to the left half
        else {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return peakIndex; // Return the peak index (if found)
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(log(arr.length))
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- Array will have a peak always ,this question 1 peak question if u read it carefully
  


## Companies:

```
Amazon -> 10
Bloomberg -> 3
Apple -> 3
Google -> 2
```
