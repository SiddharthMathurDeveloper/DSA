***Aggressive Cows version on Leetcode**

## Problem statement:
In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, 
the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.


## Example 1:

```
Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6].
The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.

```

## Example 2:

```
Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2

Output: 999999999

Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
```




## Constraints:

```
n == position.length

2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= position[i] <= 10^9

All integers in position are distinct.

2 <= m <= position.length
```


 

## Approach:

## Step 1: Sort the Array
First, sort the array of ball positions, `position`, in ascending order. Sorting makes it easier to work with the positions of the balls.

## Step 2: Define Search Range
Define a search range for the minimum distance between balls. The minimum possible distance is 0 (if two balls are at the same position), and the maximum possible distance is the difference between the first and last positions in the sorted array.

## Step 3: Binary Search
Use binary search to find the maximum distance (`ans`) that allows placing 'm' balls while maintaining the minimum distance.

## Step 4: Binary Search Iteration
- In each iteration of the binary search, calculate the mid-point of the current search range.
- Check if it's possible to place 'm' balls with a minimum distance of the mid-point distance between them using a helper function, `isPossibleToPlace`.

## Step 5: Check Possibility with Helper Function
- In the `isPossibleToPlace` function, starting from the first ball position, try to place 'm' balls while maintaining the minimum distance.
- If it's possible, update `ans` with the mid-point distance and move the search range to the right. This means we can potentially place balls farther apart.
- If it's not possible, move the search range to the left, reducing the minimum distance between balls.

## Step 6: Continue Binary Search
Continue the binary search until the search range is reduced to a single value.

## Step 7: Return Maximum Distance
Return the maximum distance (`ans`) found during the binary search.

## Example:

Let's illustrate the approach with an example:

Given `position = {1, 2, 8, 4, 9}` and `m = 3`.

**Step 1:** Sort the position array: `{1, 2, 4, 8, 9}`.

**Step 2:** Initialize `start` to 0 and `end` to 9. Initialize `ans` to -1.

**Step 3:** Perform a binary search.

   - Iteration 1:

     a. Calculate `mid` as `(0 + 9) / 2 = 4`.

     b. Check if we can place 3 cows with a distance of 4 or more between them using the `canWePlace` function.

     c. With `mid = 4`, we can place cows at positions 1, 4, and 8 (distance between adjacent cows: 3, 4), which is possible.

     d. Update `ans` to 4 and move `start` to `mid + 1 = 5`.

   - Iteration 2:

     a. Calculate `mid` as `(5 + 9) / 2 = 7`.

     b. Check if we can place 3 cows with a distance of 7 or more between them.

     c. With `mid = 7`, we can place cows at positions 1, 8, and 9 (distance between adjacent cows: 7, 1), which is possible.

     d. Update `ans` to 7 and move `start` to `mid + 1 = 8`.

   - Iteration 3:

     a. Calculate `mid` as `(8 + 9) / 2 = 8`.

     b. Check if we can place 3 cows with a distance of 8 or more between them.

     c. With `mid = 8`, we can place cows at positions 1, 8, and 9 (distance between adjacent cows: 7, 1), which is possible.

     d. Update `ans` to 8 and move `start` to `mid + 1 = 9`.

   - Iteration 4:

     a. `start` (10) is greater than `end` (9), so the binary search terminates.

**Step 4:** The maximum distance where 3 cows can be placed with at least that distance between them is `ans = 8`, so we return 8 as the answer.



## Code: 

```java
public int maxDistance(int[] position, int m) {
    // Sort the positions of the balls in ascending order.
    Arrays.sort(position);

    // Initialize the search range based on the distance between the first and last positions.
    int start = 0;
    int end = position[position.length - 1] - position[0];

    // Initialize the answer to store the maximum distance.
    int ans = 0;

    // Perform binary search to find the maximum distance.
    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

        // Check if it's possible to place 'm' balls with a minimum distance of 'mid'.
        if (isPossibleToPlace(position, m, mid)) {
            ans = mid; // Update the answer with the current 'mid'.
            start = mid + 1; // Move the search range to the right.
        } else {
            end = mid - 1; // Move the search range to the left.
        }
    }

    // Return the maximum distance that allows placing 'm' balls.
    return ans;
}

// This function checks if it's possible to place 'balls' balls with a minimum distance of 'distance' between each ball.
private boolean isPossibleToPlace(int[] position, int balls, int distance) {
    int positionLength = position.length;

    int totalBallsPlaced = 1; // Initialize the number of balls placed.
    int lastBallPosition = position[0]; // Initialize the position of the last placed ball.

    // Iterate through the positions to check placement possibilities.
    for (int i = 1; i < positionLength; i++) {
        if (position[i] - lastBallPosition >= distance) {
            totalBallsPlaced++; // Place a ball if the distance condition is met.
            lastBallPosition = position[i]; // Update the position of the last placed ball.
        }

        if (totalBallsPlaced == balls) {
            return true; // If all balls are placed, return true.
        }
    }

    return false; // Return false if it's not possible to place all balls.
}
```






## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(NlogN) + O(N * log(max(stalls[])-min(stalls[]))) 
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- Sorting being Used then Binary Search ,The extra function apart from binary Search / helper function how to code
