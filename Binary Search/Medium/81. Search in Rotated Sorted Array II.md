## Problem statement:
There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is rotated at an unknown pivot index`k``(0 <= k < nums.length)` such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` after the rotation and an integer target, return `true` if `target` is in` nums`, or `false` if it is not in nums.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0

Output: true
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3

Output: false
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
-10^4 <= target <= 10^4
```


 

## Approach (Modified Binary Search):

1. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, pointing to the beginning and the end of the array, respectively.
2. Run a binary search loop as long as `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
3. Calculate the middle index `mid` as `(start + end) / 2`.
4. Check if `nums[mid]` is equal to `target`. If it is, return `true` as the target is found.
5. If `nums[start]`, `nums[mid]`, and `nums[end]` are equal, increment `start` and decrement `end` to skip the duplicate elements. Continue to the next iteration of the loop.
6. Check if the left part of the array is sorted, i.e., `nums[start] <= nums[mid]`. If it is:
   - If `nums[start] <= target` and `nums[mid] >= target`, adjust `end` to `mid - 1` to search the left part.
   - Otherwise, adjust `start` to `mid + 1` to search the right part.
7. If the left part is not sorted, the right part must be sorted:
   - If `nums[end] >= target` and `nums[mid] <= target`, adjust `start` to `mid + 1` to search the right part.
   - Otherwise, adjust `end` to `mid - 1` to search the left part.
8. If the loop completes without finding the target, return `false` as the target is not present in the array.

## Example:

Let's consider an example to understand how the approach works:

Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], target = 0

1. Initialize `start` = 0 and `end` = 6.
2. Calculate `mid` = (0 + 6) / 2 = 3.
   - `nums[mid]` = 7 is not equal to the target 0.
   - The left part is sorted (`nums[start] <= nums[mid]`), and target = 0 lies between 4 and 7. Adjust `end` to 2 to search the left part.
3. Calculate `mid` = (0 + 2) / 2 = 1.
   - `nums[mid]` = 5 is not equal to the target 0.
   - The left part is sorted, and target = 0 is less than `nums[mid]` = 5. Adjust `end` to 0 to search the left part.
4. Calculate `mid` = (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.
   - `nums[mid]` = 4 is not equal to the target 0.
   - The left part is sorted, and target = 0 is less than `nums[mid]` = 4. Adjust `end` to -1, which exits the loop.
5. The loop completes without finding the target, so return `false`.

In this example, the target 0 is not found in the rotated sorted array, so the algorithm returns `false`.



## Code: 

```java
  public boolean search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;

        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return true; // If target is found, return true
            }

            // Check if the current window contains duplicate elements at both ends
            if (nums[start] == nums[mid] && nums[end] == nums[mid]) {
                start = start + 1; // Move start to the right to skip the duplicate
                end = end - 1; // Move end to the left to skip the duplicate
                continue; // Continue to the next iteration of the loop
            }

            // Check if the left part of the array is sorted
            if (nums[start] <= nums[mid]) {
                // If target lies within the sorted left part
                if (nums[start] <= target && nums[mid] >= target) {
                    end = mid - 1; // Adjust end index to search left part
                } else {
                    start = mid + 1; // Adjust start index to search right part
                }
            }
            
            // Check if the right part of the array is sorted
            else {
                // If target lies within the sorted right part
                if (nums[end] >= target && nums[mid] <= target) {
                    start = mid + 1; // Adjust start index to search right part
                } else {
                    end = mid - 1; // Adjust end index to search left part
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false; // If target is not found, return false
    }
