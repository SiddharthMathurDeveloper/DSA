## Problem statement:
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we will choose a positive integer `divisor`, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. 
Find the smallest `divisor` such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to threshold.

Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: `7/3 = 3` and `10/2 = 5`).

The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6

Output: 5

Explanation: We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1. 
If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum of 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2). 
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [44,22,33,11,1], threshold = 5

Output: 44
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4

1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

nums.length <= threshold <= 10^6
```


 

## Approach (Binary Search on Answer) :

1. **Calculate Maximum and Minimum:**

    Calculate the maximum and minimum values in the array using the `getMaxAndMin` function. For the example, `maxValue = 9` and `minValue = 1`.

2. **Initialize Binary Search Range:**

    Initialize the start of the binary search range as `1` and the end as the maximum value in the array. For the example, `start = 1` and `end = 9`.

3. **Binary Search Loop:**

    While the `start` index is less than or equal to the `end` index, perform the following steps:

    - Calculate the middle divisor: `mid = (start + end) / 2`.

    - Use the `isPossible` function to check if it's possible to divide the array elements using the current divisor such that the sum of elements is less than or equal to the `threshold`.

    - If it's possible, update the answer with the current divisor and move the `end` index to search in the left half of the range.

    - If it's not possible, move the `start` index to search in the right half of the range.

4. **Return Smallest Divisor:**

    Finally, return the smallest divisor that satisfies the condition.

## Example Walkthrough:

For `nums = [1, 2, 5, 9]` and `threshold = 6`:

- Calculate the maximum and minimum values in the array: `maxValue = 9` and `minValue = 1`.

- Initialize the binary search range: `start = 1`, `end = 9`.

- First Iteration:

    - Calculate the middle divisor: `mid = (1 + 9) / 2 = 5`.
    - Check if it's possible to divide the array elements using the divisor 5. The sum of elements would be `(1/5) + (2/5) + (5/5) + (9/5) = 3.4`, which is less than the threshold 6. So, it's possible. Update the answer with 5 and move the `end` index to the left.

- Second Iteration:

    - Calculate the middle divisor: `mid = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3`.
    - Check if it's possible to divide the array elements using the divisor 3. The sum of elements would be `(1/3) + (2/3) + (5/3) + (9/3) = 7.67`, which is greater than the threshold 6. So, it's not possible. Move the `start` index to the right.

- Third Iteration:

    - Calculate the middle divisor: `mid = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4`.
    - Check if it's possible to divide the array elements using the divisor 4. The sum of elements would be `(1/4) + (2/4) + (5/4) + (9/4) = 5.75`, which is greater than the threshold 6. So, it's not possible. Move the `start` index to the right.

- Final Iteration:

    - Calculate the middle divisor: `mid = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4`.
    - Check if it's possible to divide the array elements using the divisor 4. The sum of elements would be `(1/4) + (2/4) + (5/4) + (9/4) = 5.75`, which is greater than the threshold 6. So, it's not possible. Move the `start` index to the right.

- Binary Search Loop Ends:

    The algorithm returns the smallest divisor that satisfies the condition, which is 5.

In this example, the algorithm successfully found the smallest divisor that makes the sum of array elements divided by that divisor less than or equal to the threshold, which is 5.




## Code: 

```java
public int smallestDivisor(int[] nums, int threshold) {
    int[] maxAndMinValue = getMaxAndMin(nums);  // Get the maximum and minimum values in the array
    int start = 1;  // Start divisor for binary search
    int end = maxAndMinValue[0];  // End divisor for binary search

    int ans = -1;  // Initialize the answer

    // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;  // Calculate the middle divisor

        // Check if it's possible to divide the array elements with the current divisor
        if (isPossible(nums, threshold, mid)) {
            ans = mid;  // Update the answer with the current divisor
            end = mid - 1;  // Move the end index to search in the left half
        } else {
            start = mid + 1;  // Move the start index to search in the right half
        }
    }

    return ans;
}

// Get the maximum and minimum values in the array
private int[] getMaxAndMin(int[] nums) {
    int maxValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    int minValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    for (int num : nums) {
        maxValue = Math.max(maxValue, num);
        minValue = Math.min(minValue, num);
    }

    return new int[]{maxValue, minValue};
}

// Check if it's possible to divide the array elements with the given divisor
private boolean isPossible(int[] nums, int threshold, int divisor) {
    int sumOfElements = 0;

    // Calculate the sum of elements when divided by the current divisor
    for (int num : nums) {
        int currentSum = (int) Math.ceil((float) num / (float) divisor);
        sumOfElements += currentSum;
    }

    // Check if the sum of elements is less than or equal to the threshold
    return sumOfElements <= threshold;
}
