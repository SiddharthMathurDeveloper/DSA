## Problem statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, split `nums` into `k` non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized.

Return the minimized largest sum of the split.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2

Output: 18

Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

Output: 9

Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [1,2,3] and [4,5], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 1000

0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

1 <= k <= min(50, nums.length)
```

## Code: 

```java

```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N * log(sum(arr[])-max(arr[])+1))
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- Taking `max` rather than `min` on start value ,the helper method
