## Look for these words
```
-> Sorted ,
-> Searching,
-> Target value ,
-> Inserted in order ,
-> Inserted in position ,
```


## Note

```
-> Elimination is the Key in most the problems

-> You have to identify which portion you are sure to eliminate so be sure if you identify
the portion to be elimanated and then you can write binary Search for anything

-> The questions which have duplicates always try to solve the problem in terms of unique (as in test cases) , then see where unique will fail , then try to fit that failed condition in that algorithm
```
