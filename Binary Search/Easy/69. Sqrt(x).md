## Problem statement:
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be `non-negative` as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.


## Example 1:

```
Input: x = 4

Output: 2

Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: x = 8

Output: 2

Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```



## Constraints:

```
0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
```


 

## Approach (Binary Search on Answer):

1. **Initialize the Search Range:** Initialize the search range for the possible square root values. The range starts from 0 (minimum possible square root) and ends at `x` (maximum possible square root).

2. **Binary Search for Square Root:**

    - Calculate the middle value `mid` between the start and end of the search range.
    - Check if the square of `mid` is equal to `x`. If it is, return `mid` as the square root.
    - If the square of `mid` is less than `x`, update the answer to `mid` and move the search range to the right half by updating `start` to `mid + 1`.
    - If the square of `mid` is greater than `x`, move the search range to the left half by updating `end` to `mid - 1`.
    
3. **Return the Answer:**

    After the binary search loop, return the value of the answer, which represents the integer square root of `x`.

By using binary search, we are efficiently narrowing down the search range for the possible square root value until we find the exact answer or the closest value.

## Example:

Let's consider an example:

Input: x = 8

- Initialize `start` = 0 and `end` = 8.
- Calculate `mid` = (0 + 8) / 2 = 4.
- `mid * mid` = 4 * 4 = 16, which is greater than 8. Update `end` = 4 - 1 = 3.
- Calculate `mid` = (0 + 3) / 2 = 1.
- `mid * mid` = 1 * 1 = 1, which is less than 8. Update the answer to `mid` = 1 and update `start` = 1 + 1 = 2.
- Calculate `mid` = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.
- `mid * mid` = 2 * 2 = 4, which is less than 8. Update the answer to `mid` = 2 and update `start` = 2 + 1 = 3.
- Calculate `mid` = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3.
- `mid * mid` = 3 * 3 = 9, which is greater than 8. Update `end` = 3 - 1 = 2.



## Code: 

```java
public int mySqrt(int x) {
        // Initialize the search range
        long start = 0;
        long end = x;

        int ans = -1;

        // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
        while (start <= end) {
            long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            if (mid * mid == x) {
                ans = (int) mid; // Square of mid is equal to x, store the value of mid as ans
                break; // Found the square root, exit the loop
            }

            // If square of mid is less than x, update ans and search in the right half
            else if (mid * mid < x) {
                ans = (int) mid; // Update the answer to the current mid
                start = mid + 1; // Move to the right half
            } else {
                end = mid - 1; // Square of mid is greater than x, search in the left half
            }
        }

        return ans; // Return the integer square root of x
    }
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(log N) 
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- When a range is given and we have search apply binary search on answers concept
