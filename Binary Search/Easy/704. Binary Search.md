## Problem statement:
Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9

Output: 4

Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2

Output: -1

Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.
```


 

## Approach (Itervative):



Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. At each step, we compare the middle element of the current interval with the target element we are searching for. If the middle element is equal to the target, we return its index. If the middle element is greater than the target, we adjust the search interval to the left half. If the middle element is smaller than the target, we adjust the search interval to the right half. We repeat this process until the search interval becomes empty or we find the target element.

## Iterative Binary Search Approach:

1. Initialize `start` to the index 0 and `end` to the index `nums.length - 1`.
2. While `start` is less than or equal to `end`, repeat the following steps:
   - Calculate the middle index as `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is equal to `target`, return `mid` as the index where the target is found.
   - If `nums[mid]` is greater than `target`, adjust `end` to `mid - 1`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is smaller than `target`, adjust `start` to `mid + 1`.
3. If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the target is not present in the array.

## Example:

Let's consider an example to understand how the approach works:

Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9

Initial `start = 0` and `end = 5`.

- Calculate `mid = 0 + (5 - 0) / 2 = 2`.
- `nums[mid] = nums[2] = 3`, which is smaller than the target 9. Adjust `start = mid + 1 = 3`.
- Calculate `mid = 3 + (5 - 3) / 2 = 4`.
- `nums[mid] = nums[4] = 9`, which is equal to the target 9. Return `mid = 4`.

In this example, the target 9 is found at index 4.





## Code: 

```java
 public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0; // Initialize the start index of the binary search range
        int end = nums.length - 1; // Initialize the end index of the binary search range

        // Perform binary search until the start index is less than or equal to the end index
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; // Calculate the middle index

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid; // If the middle element is the target, return its index
            } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
                end = mid - 1; // If the middle element is greater than the target, adjust the end index
            } else {
                start = mid + 1; // If the middle element is smaller than the target, adjust the start index
            }
        }

        return -1; // If the target is not found in the array, return -1
    }
```
