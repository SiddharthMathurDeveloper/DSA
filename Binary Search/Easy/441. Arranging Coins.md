## Problem statement:
You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `ith` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

## Example 1:

```
Input: n = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: n = 8

Output: 3

Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```
