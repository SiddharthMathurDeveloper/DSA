## Problem statement:
You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `ith` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

## Example 1:

```
Input: n = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: n = 8

Output: 3

Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
```

## Code: 

```java
public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
    long start = 1;  // Start of the range of possible rows
    long end = n;    // End of the range of possible rows

    int ans = 0;     // Initialize the answer

    // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
    while (start <= end) {
        long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;  // Calculate the middle number of rows

        long coinsUsed = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;  // Calculate the total coins used for mid rows

        // If the total coins used is equal to n, return the current number of rows
        if (coinsUsed == n) {
            return (int) mid;
        }
        // If the total coins used is less than n, update the answer and search in the right half
        else if (coinsUsed < n) {
            ans = (int) mid;  // Update the answer to the current mid
            start = mid + 1;  // Move to the right half
        } else {
            end = mid - 1;    // Total coins used is greater than n, search in the left half
        }
    }

    return (int) ans;  // Return the answer (number of rows)
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(log N)
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- How to use long rather in when values becomes too large (like mid*mid) when multiplying and Maths (sum of till  number nth)
