## Problem statement:
You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `ith` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

## Example 1:

```
Input: n = 5

Output: 2

Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: n = 8

Output: 3

Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
```


 

## Approach:

1. **Initial Range:**

    Start with an initial range for the number of rows. Since we are trying to maximize the number of rows, we can set the range as follows:

    - `start = 1`: Minimum possible number of rows.
    - `end = n`: Maximum possible number of rows (using all coins).

2. **Binary Search Loop:**

    Perform a binary search loop until the `start` index is less than or equal to the `end` index.

    - Calculate the `mid` value as the average of `start` and `end`.

    - Calculate the total number of coins used to form `mid` rows using the formula: `coinsUsed = mid * (mid + 1) / 2`.

    - **Case 1: Exact Match**

        If `coinsUsed` is equal to `n`, it means we have found the exact number of rows that can be formed using the given coins. Return `mid` as the answer.

    - **Case 2: Insufficient Coins**

        If `coinsUsed` is less than `n`, it means we can arrange more than `mid` rows. In this case, update the answer to `mid` and search in the right half by updating `start = mid + 1`.

    - **Case 3: Excess Coins**

        If `coinsUsed` is greater than `n`, it means we cannot form that many rows with the given coins. In this case, search in the left half by updating `end = mid - 1`.

3. **Return Answer:**

    After the binary search loop, return the answer, which represents the maximum number of complete rows that can be formed.

## Example 

For `n = 14`:

- Initial Range: `start = 1`, `end = 14`.

- First Iteration:

    - `mid = (1 + 14) / 2 = 7`.
    - `coinsUsed = 7 * 8 / 2 = 28`.
    - Since `coinsUsed` (28) is greater than `n` (14), we update `end = mid - 1`, so `end` becomes 6.

- Second Iteration:

    - `mid = (1 + 6) / 2 = 3`.
    - `coinsUsed = 3 * 4 / 2 = 6`.
    - Since `coinsUsed` (6) is less than `n` (14), we update `start = mid + 1`, so `start` becomes 4.

- Third Iteration:

    - `mid = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5`.
    - `coinsUsed = 5 * 6 / 2 = 15`.
    - Since `coinsUsed` (15) is greater than `n` (14), we update `end = mid - 1`, so `end` becomes 4.

- Fourth Iteration:

    - `mid = (4 + 4) / 2 = 4`.
    - `coinsUsed = 4 * 5 / 2 = 10`.
    - Since `coinsUsed` (10) is less than `n` (14), we update `start = mid + 1`, so `start` becomes 5.

- Fifth Iteration:

    - `mid = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4`.
    - `coinsUsed = 4 * 5 / 2 = 10`.
    - Since `coinsUsed` (10) is less than `n` (14), we update `start = mid + 1`, so `start` becomes 5.

- Binary Search Loop Ends:

   The binary search loop ends, and the answer is 4, which represents the maximum number of complete rows that can be formed using 14 coins.


## Code: 

```java
public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
    long start = 1;  // Start of the range of possible rows
    long end = n;    // End of the range of possible rows

    int ans = 0;     // Initialize the answer

    // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
    while (start <= end) {
        long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;  // Calculate the middle number of rows

        long coinsUsed = mid * (mid + 1) / 2;  // Calculate the total coins used for mid rows

        // If the total coins used is equal to n, return the current number of rows
        if (coinsUsed == n) {
            return (int) mid;
        }
        // If the total coins used is less than n, update the answer and search in the right half
        else if (coinsUsed < n) {
            ans = (int) mid;  // Update the answer to the current mid
            start = mid + 1;  // Move to the right half
        } else {
            end = mid - 1;    // Total coins used is greater than n, search in the left half
        }
    }

    return (int) ans;  // Return the answer (number of rows)
}
```
