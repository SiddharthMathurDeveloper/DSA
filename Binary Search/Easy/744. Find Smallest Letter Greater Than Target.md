<h1 align="center"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/" target="_blank">744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target</a></h1>

## Problem statement:
You are given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character `target`. There are at least two different characters in `letters`.

Return the smallest character in `letters` that is lexicographically greater than `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in `letters`.


## Example 1:

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"

Output: "c"

Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"

Output: "f"

Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"

Output: "x"

Explanation: There are no characters in letters that is lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
```


## Constraints:

```
2 <= letters.length <= 10^4

letters[i] is a lowercase English letter.

letters is sorted in non-decreasing order.

letters contains at least two different characters.

target is a lowercase English letter.
```


 

## Approach:


1. **Check First Letter:**

    - If the first letter in the array is greater than the target, return that letter as it's the smallest letter greater than the target.

2. **Binary Search:**

    - Perform a binary search to find the smallest letter in the array that is greater than the target. Use the binary search to efficiently narrow down the search range.

    - If such a letter is found, return it as the result. If not, return the smallest letter in the array as the result.

## Example:

Let's consider the following example:

- `letters = ['a', 'c', 'f', 'h']`
- `target = 'd'`

### Step 1: Check First Letter

- The first letter in the array is 'a', and it's smaller than the target 'd'. Move to step 2.

### Step 2: Perform Binary Search

- `Start = 0`, `End = 3`, `Mid = 1` (letter 'c').

    - Since 'c' > 'd', update `ans = 'c'` and move to the left half.

- `Start = 0`, `End = 0`, `Mid = 0` (letter 'a').

    - Since 'a' < 'd', move to the right half.

### Step 3: Result

- The binary search ends with `ans = 'c'` as it's the smallest letter greater than the target 'd'. Return 'c' as the result.

In this example, the algorithm successfully found the smallest letter in the array that is greater than the target 'd', which is 'c'.



## Code: 

```java
public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
    // If the first letter is greater than the target, it is the smallest letter
    if (letters[0] > target) {
        return letters[0];
    }

    int start = 0;  // Start index of the search range
    int end = letters.length - 1;  // End index of the search range

    int ans = -1;  // Initialize the answer

    // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;  // Calculate the middle index

        // Check if the middle letter is greater than the target
        if (letters[mid] > target) {
            ans = (int) letters[mid];  // Update the answer with the current letter
            end = mid - 1;  // Move the end index to search in the left half
        } else {
            start = mid + 1;  // Move the start index to search in the right half
        }
    }

    // If ans is still -1, it means no greater letter was found
    // Return the smallest letter in the array (circular property)
    // Otherwise, return the letter corresponding to the ans value
    return ans == -1 ? letters[0] : (char) ans;
}
