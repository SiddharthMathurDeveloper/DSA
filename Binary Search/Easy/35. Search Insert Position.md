## Problem statement:
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5

Output: 2
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2

Output: 1
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7

Output: 4
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
-10^4 <= target <= 10^4
```


 

## Approach (Best):

**Approach (Binary Search for Lower Bound):**

**Initialization:** Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, to define the current search range. Set `ans` to the length of the input array as the default answer.

**Binary Search Loop:** While `start` is less than or equal to `end`, perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the middle index `mid` as `start + (end - start) / 2`.
2. Compare the value at `nums[mid]` with the target:
   - If `nums[mid]` is greater than or equal to the target:
     - Update `ans` to `mid`.
     - Adjust `end` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
   - If `nums[mid]` is smaller than the target:
     - Adjust `start` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.

**Final Answer:** Once the binary search loop completes, the `ans` variable holds the index where the target should be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of the array.

**Return:** Return the `ans` as the final answer, representing the index where the target should be inserted.

## Example:

Let's consider an example to understand how the approach works:

Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5

- Initialize `start = 0` and `end = 3`.
- Calculate `mid = 0 + (3 - 0) / 2 = 1`.
- `nums[mid] = 3` is smaller than the target 5. Adjust `start = mid + 1 = 2`.
- Calculate `mid = 2 + (3 - 2) / 2 = 2`.
- `nums[mid] = 5` is equal to the target 5. Update `ans = mid = 2`.
- The binary search loop completes.

In this example, the target 5 should be inserted at index 2 to maintain the sorted order.





## Code: 

```java
public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
    int start = 0; // Initialize the start index of the binary search range
    int end = nums.length - 1; // Initialize the end index of the binary search range
    int ans = nums.length; // Initialize a variable to store the answer (default to the length of the array)

    // Perform binary search until the start index is less than or equal to the end index
    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; // Calculate the middle index

        if (nums[mid] >= target) {
            ans = mid; // Update the answer to the current middle index
            end = mid - 1; // Adjust the end index to search in the left half
        } else {
            start = mid + 1; // Adjust the start index to search in the right half
        }
    }

    return ans; // Return the final answer, which represents the index to insert the target
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(Log(N))
Space complexity: O(1)
```
