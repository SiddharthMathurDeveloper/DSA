## Problem statement:
Given a positive integer num, return `true` if `num` is a perfect square or `false` otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as `sqrt`.


## Example 1:

```
Input: num = 16

Output: true

Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: num = 14

Output: false

Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1
```


 

## Approach:

1. **Initialize Binary Search Range:**

   - Initialize `start` to 1 (the smallest possible perfect square) and `end` to `num` (the largest possible perfect square can be `num` itself).

   - Initialize `isValidPerfectSquare` to `false`, which will be set to `true` if the number is found to be a perfect square.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**

   - Enter a binary search loop while `start` is less than or equal to `end`.

   - In each iteration:

     a. Calculate the middle value `mid` as the average of `start` and `end`.

     b. Check if `mid * mid` is equal to `num`. If it is, then `num` is a perfect square, so set `isValidPerfectSquare` to `true` and return `true`.

     c. If `mid * mid` is less than `num`, it means we need to search in the right half. So, set `start` to `mid + 1`.

     d. If `mid * mid` is greater than `num`, it means we need to search in the left half. So, set `end` to `mid - 1`.

3. **Binary Search Completion:**

   - If the loop completes and we haven't found a perfect square, return `isValidPerfectSquare` as `false`.

## Example:

Let's illustrate the approach with an example:

Given `num = 16`.

**Step 1:** Initialize `start` to 1 and `end` to 16.

**Step 2:** Enter the loop.

   a. Calculate `mid` as `(1 + 16) / 2 = 8`.

   b. Check if `mid * mid` is equal to `num`. It is, so we set `isValidPerfectSquare` to `true` and return `true`.

The algorithm concludes that 16 is a perfect square, and `isValidPerfectSquare` is set to `true`.




## Code: 

```java
public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
    // Initialize the search range using long data type to avoid integer overflow
    long start = 1;
    long end = num;

    boolean isValidPerfectSquare = false;  // Initialize the result as false

    // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
    while (start <= end) {
        long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;  // Calculate the middle value

        // Check if the square of the middle value is equal to the input number
        if (mid * mid == num) {
            isValidPerfectSquare = true;  // Update the result to true
            return isValidPerfectSquare;  // Return true, as a perfect square was found
        }
        // If the square of the middle value is less than the input number
        else if (mid * mid < num) {
            start = mid + 1;  // Move the start index to the right half
        }
        // If the square of the middle value is greater than the input number
        else {
            end = mid - 1;  // Move the end index to the left half
        }
    }

    return isValidPerfectSquare;  // Return false, as no perfect square was found
}
```
