## Problem statement:
Given a positive integer num, return `true` if `num` is a perfect square or `false` otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as `sqrt`.


## Example 1:

```
Input: num = 16

Output: true

Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: num = 14

Output: false

Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1
```


 

## Approach:

## Code: 

```java
public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
    // Initialize the search range using long data type to avoid integer overflow
    long start = 1;
    long end = num;

    boolean isValidPerfectSquare = false;  // Initialize the result as false

    // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
    while (start <= end) {
        long mid = start + (end - start) / 2;  // Calculate the middle value

        // Check if the square of the middle value is equal to the input number
        if (mid * mid == num) {
            isValidPerfectSquare = true;  // Update the result to true
            return isValidPerfectSquare;  // Return true, as a perfect square was found
        }
        // If the square of the middle value is less than the input number
        else if (mid * mid < num) {
            start = mid + 1;  // Move the start index to the right half
        }
        // If the square of the middle value is greater than the input number
        else {
            end = mid - 1;  // Move the end index to the left half
        }
    }

    return isValidPerfectSquare;  // Return false, as no perfect square was found
}
```
