## Problem statement:


## Example 1:

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6

Output: 6
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1

Output: 1
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1

Output: 1
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

1 <= pick <= n
```


 

## Approach:

1. **Initialize the Range:**

   - The target number is somewhere between 1 and n, so we initialize our search range with `start` = 1 and `end` = n.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**

    - We use a binary search loop to narrow down the search range iteratively. At each step, we calculate the middle number `mid` of the current search range (`start`, `end`).

3. **Guess the Number:**

    - We use the provided guess API to guess the number `mid`.

4. **Adjust the Range based on Guess:**

    - If the guess result is 0, it means we have guessed the target number correctly. We store `mid` as the answer and return it.

    - If the guess result is -1, it means the guessed number is smaller than the target. Therefore, the target number must be greater than `mid`, so we update `start` = `mid + 1` to search in the right half of the range.

    - If the guess result is 1, it means the guessed number is larger than the target. Therefore, the target number must be less than `mid`, so we update `end` = `mid - 1` to search in the left half of the range.

5. **Repeat the Loop:**

    - We continue the binary search loop until the `start` index is less than or equal to the `end` index. This ensures that the search range is valid and hasn't been exhausted.

6. **Return the Answer:**

    - If we find the target number within the loop, we return it as the answer. If the loop completes without finding the target number, we return -1.



## Code: 

```java
public int guessNumber(int n) {
    int start = 1;  // Start of the range of possible numbers
    int end = n;    // End of the range of possible numbers

    int ans = -1;   // Initialize the answer

    // Perform binary search until start index is less than or equal to end index
    while (start <= end) {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;  // Calculate the middle number

        // Use the guess API to determine the relationship of mid with the target number
        int numberFromGuessApi = guess(mid);

        // If the guess API returns 0, we found the target number, so store it in the answer and return
        if (numberFromGuessApi == 0) {
            ans = mid;
            return ans;
        }
        // If the guess API returns -1, the target number is smaller, so search in the left half
        else if (numberFromGuessApi == -1) {
            end = mid - 1;  // Move the end index to mid - 1
        }
        // If the guess API returns 1, the target number is larger, so search in the right half
        else {
            start = mid + 1; // Move the start index to mid + 1
        }
    }

    return ans; // Return the answer (target number)
}
```
