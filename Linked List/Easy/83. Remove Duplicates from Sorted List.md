## Problem statement:
Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.




## Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,1,2]

Output: [1,2]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]

Output: [1,2,3]
```





## Constraints:

```
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100

The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
```


 

## Approach:

### Input Validation

Before removing duplicates from the list, it's important to perform input validation to check for special cases:

1. Check if the input `head` is null or if the list has only one node (i.e., `head.next == null`). If either condition is true, return the original list because there are no duplicates to remove.

### Initialize a Temporary Pointer

Create a temporary pointer `temp` and set it to the head of the list. This pointer will be used to traverse the list.

### Iteration Through the List

Start a while loop that continues until `temp` reaches the end of the list (i.e., `temp != null`).

Within the loop, compare the current node's value (i.e., `temp.val`) with the value of the next node (i.e., `temp.next.val`).

### Detecting Duplicate Nodes

- If `temp` and `temp.next` have the same value (i.e., `temp.val == temp.next.val`), it means a duplicate node is found.
- In this case, update the next pointer of the current node (`temp`) to skip the duplicate node by pointing it to the node after the duplicate (i.e., `temp.next = temp.next.next`).

### Advancing the Pointer

- If no duplicate is found, move the `temp` pointer to the next node by setting `temp = temp.next`.

### Completion of Iteration

Continue this process until `temp` reaches the end of the list.

### Return the Modified List

Once the loop finishes, all duplicates in the list will have been removed, and the original list (with duplicates removed) is returned as the result.
 



## Code: 

```java
public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        // Check if the input list is empty or has only one node (no duplicates to remove).
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head; // Return the original list as there are no duplicates to remove.
        }

        ListNode temp = head; // Initialize a temporary pointer to the head of the list.

        // Traverse the list.
        while (temp != null) {
            // Check if there is a duplicate node next to the current node.
            if (temp.next != null && temp.val == temp.next.val) {
                temp.next = temp.next.next; // Skip the duplicate node by updating the next pointer.
            } else {
                temp = temp.next; // Move to the next node if no duplicate is found.
            }
        }

        // Return the modified list with duplicates removed.
        return head;
    }
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N)  
Space complexity: O(1) 
```

## Things I Learned:

- Move to next node  new node with only when before that are not same , from one node check like eg[ 1 ,1 ,1 ,2  ] -> 1 check(index 1)same,1 check(index 2)same,1 check(index 1)different then move
