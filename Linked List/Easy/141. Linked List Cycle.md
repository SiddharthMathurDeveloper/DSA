## Problem statement:
Given head, the `head` of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`


## Example 1:

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1

Output: true

Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0

Output: true

Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1

Output: false

Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```




## Constraints:

```

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

```


 

## Approach:

### Initialize Two Pointers

- Initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both initially set to the head of the linked list.
- The `fast` pointer advances by two nodes at a time, while the `slow` pointer advances by one node at a time.

### Iterate Through the List

- Start a while loop that continues as long as `fast` and `fast.next` are not null. This loop is used to traverse the linked list.

### Moving the Pointers

- In each iteration of the loop, move the `fast` pointer two steps ahead (i.e., `fast = fast.next.next`) and the `slow` pointer one step ahead (i.e., `slow = slow.next`).

### Detecting a Cycle

- Check if the `fast` pointer is equal to the `slow` pointer. If they meet at the same node (i.e., `fast == slow`), it means a cycle is detected in the linked list.

### Return True for a Cycle

- If a cycle is detected, return true to indicate that the linked list has a cycle.

### Return False for No Cycle

- If the while loop completes without detecting a cycle (i.e., `fast` reaches the end of the list), return false to indicate that there is no cycle in the linked list.

This approach uses two pointers moving at different speeds to traverse the linked list. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer, and the function returns true. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list, and the function returns false.

 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    // Initialize two pointers, fast and slow, both initially set to the head of the linked list.
    ListNode fast = head;
    ListNode slow = head;

    // Iterate through the linked list.
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        // Move the fast pointer two steps ahead.
        fast = fast.next.next;
        // Move the slow pointer one step ahead.
        slow = slow.next;

        // Check if the fast pointer equals the slow pointer.
        if (fast == slow) {
            // If they meet at the same node, it indicates a cycle in the linked list.
            return true;
        }
    }

    // If the while loop completes without finding a cycle, return false.
    return false;
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N) 
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- Floyed Fast and Slow Pointer Trick , Fast && Fast.next together because it could jump 2 time makes fast Null , so if fast.next is only there will give
  null pointer expection or before fast (fast.next && fast) [Null] , also , fast.next to check that next node not null that means lasting on last node
