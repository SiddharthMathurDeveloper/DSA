## Problem statement:
Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.


## Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,0,1]

Output: 5

Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: head = [0]

Output: 0
```




## Constraints:

```
The Linked List is not empty.

Number of nodes will not exceed 30.

Each node's value is either 0 or 1.
```


 

## Approach:

The goal of this code is to convert a binary number represented as a singly-linked list into its decimal equivalent. Each node in the linked list contains a binary digit (0 or 1), with the head representing the most significant bit (MSB) and the tail representing the least significant bit (LSB).

To convert the linked list to a decimal value, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a temporary pointer to the head of the linked list.
2. Initialize a variable to store the decimal value, initially set to 0.
3. Traverse the linked list from MSB to LSB:
   - Left shift the current sum by 1 to make room for the next binary digit.
   - Add the current node's value (0 or 1) to the sum.
   - Move the temporary pointer to the next node in the linked list.
4. The final value in the `sum` variable will be the decimal representation of the binary linked list.
5. Return the calculated decimal value.

## Example

Let's say we have a binary linked list representing the binary number 1101:
1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1


1. Initialize `tempPointer` to the head of the linked list (1st node).
2. Initialize `sum` to 0.
3. Start traversing the list:

   - Initially, `sum` is 0.
   - For the first node (MSB, value = 1):
     - Left shift `sum` by 1: `sum` = 0.
     - Add the node's value: `sum` = 1.
     - Move to the next node.
   
   - For the second node (value = 1):
     - Left shift `sum` by 1: `sum` = 2.
     - Add the node's value: `sum` = 3.
     - Move to the next node.
   
   - For the third node (value = 0):
     - Left shift `sum` by 1: `sum` = 6.
     - Add the node's value: `sum` = 6.
     - Move to the next node.
   
   - For the fourth node (LSB, value = 1):
     - Left shift `sum` by 1: `sum` = 12.
     - Add the node's value: `sum` = 13.
     - Move to the next node (which is null, indicating the end of the list).

4. The final value of `sum` is 13, which is the decimal representation of the binary number 1101.

5. Return 13 as the result.

So, the function `getDecimalValue` would return 13 for the given example.




## Code: 

```java
public int getDecimalValue(ListNode head) {
        // Initialize a temporary pointer to the head of the linked list.
        ListNode tempPointer = head;
        
        // Initialize a variable to store the decimal value, initially set to 0.
        int sum = 0;
        
        // Traverse the linked list until the end is reached (null is encountered).
        while (tempPointer != null) {
            // Left shift the current sum by 1 to make room for the next binary digit.
            sum *= 2;
            
            // Add the current node's value (0 or 1) to the sum.
            sum += tempPointer.val;
            
            // Move the temporary pointer to the next node in the linked list.
            tempPointer = tempPointer.next;
        }
        
        // The final 'sum' variable now holds the decimal value of the binary representation
        // of the linked list.
        int decimalValue = sum;
        
        // Return the calculated decimal value.
        return decimalValue;
 }
```
