## Problem statement:
Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.


## Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,0,1]

Output: 5

Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: head = [0]

Output: 0
```




## Constraints:

```
The Linked List is not empty.

Number of nodes will not exceed 30.

Each node's value is either 0 or 1.
```
