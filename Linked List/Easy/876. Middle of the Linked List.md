## Problem statement:
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


## Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [3,4,5]

Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: [4,5,6]

Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```



## Constraints:

```
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].

1 <= Node.val <= 100
```

## Code: 

```java

## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N) 
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- Using Floyed fast slow pointer with Math, if u think fast is twice of slow ,so 2xslow=fast (5x2=10) if u see this you u notice that end of loop slow will always be pointing to middle
  5x2 = 10 slow x2 == fast ,u think logically slow alwaysi n middle
