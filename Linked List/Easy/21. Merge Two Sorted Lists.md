## Problem statement:
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.


## Example 1:

```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]

Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []

Output: []
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]

Output: [0]
```


## Constraints:

```
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].

-100 <= Node.val <= 100

Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
```


 

## Approach:

### Initialization

- Create a dummy node to simplify list manipulation. The `dummyNode` will serve as the starting point of the merged list.
- Initialize a `tail` pointer to keep track of the last node in the merged list.

### Merging Lists

- Use a while loop to traverse both input lists (`list1` and `list2`) simultaneously while they are not empty.
- Compare the values of the current nodes in `list1` and `list2`, and append the smaller-valued node to the merged list pointed to by `tail`. Move the respective pointer (`list1` or `list2`) to the next node.

### Advancing the tail Pointer

- After appending a node to the merged list, advance the `tail` pointer to the newly added node.

### Appending Remaining Nodes

- After the loop, one of the input lists may still have remaining nodes. Check if `list1` or `list2` is not null, and if so, append the remaining nodes to the merged list.

### Returning the Merged List

- Return the merged list starting from the node after the dummy node (`dummyNode.next`). This is because the dummy node itself is not part of the merged list; it's only used for ease of manipulation.



## Code: 

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
        // Create a dummy node to simplify list manipulation.
        ListNode dummyNode = new ListNode();
        // Initialize a tail pointer to keep track of the last node in the merged list.
        ListNode tail = dummyNode;

        // Traverse both input lists while they are not empty.
        while (list1 != null && list2 != null) {
            if (list1.val < list2.val) {
                // If the current node in list1 has a smaller value, append it to the merged list.
                tail.next = list1;
                list1 = list1.next; // Move to the next node in list1.
            } else {
                // If the current node in list2 has a smaller or equal value, append it to the merged list.
                tail.next = list2;
                list2 = list2.next; // Move to the next node in list2.
            }
            tail = tail.next; // Move the tail pointer to the newly added node.
        }

        // After the loop, one of the input lists may still have remaining nodes.
        // Append the remaining nodes, if any, to the merged list.
        if (list1 != null) {
            tail.next = list1;
        } else if (list2 != null) {
            tail.next = list2;
        }

        // Return the merged list starting from the node after the dummy node.
        return dummyNode.next;
    }
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N)  
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- Inserting a Dummy Node to avoid edge case trick, in adding remaing element of either of two list by just reference them rather than looping them
