## Problem statement:
Given the `head` of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

`Do not modify the linked list.


## Example 1:

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1

Output: tail connects to node index 1

Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0

Output: tail connects to node index 0

Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1

Output: no cycle

Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```


## Constraints:

```
The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].

-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

## Approach:

### Initialization

- Initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.

### Traverse the List

- Use a while loop to traverse the linked list with the `fast` and `slow` pointers.
- The `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time (`fast = fast.next.next`), while the `slow` pointer moves one step at a time (`slow = slow.next`).

### Cycle Detection

- Check if the `fast` pointer equals the `slow` pointer. If they meet, it indicates the presence of a cycle in the linked list.

### Cycle Detection - Finding the Starting Node

- If a cycle is detected, reset one of the pointers (in this case, `entry`) to the head of the list.

### Move Pointers to Find the Cycle's Starting Node

- Continue iterating both the `entry` and `slow` pointers until they meet. The point where they meet is the starting node of the cycle.

### Return the Starting Node

- Return the node where the `entry` and `slow` pointers meet, which is the starting node of the cycle.

### No Cycle Detected

- If the loop completes without finding a cycle (i.e., `fast` reaches the end of the list), return null to indicate that there is no cycle in the linked list.

This code efficiently detects and returns the starting node of a cycle in a singly linked list using the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm. If there is no cycle, it returns null.

 public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        // Initialize two pointers, fast and slow, both initially set to the head of the linked list.
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;

        // Traverse the linked list with the fast and slow pointers.
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next; // Fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
            slow = slow.next; // Slow pointer moves one step at a time.

            // If the fast pointer meets the slow pointer, indicating a cycle:
            if (fast == slow) {
                // Reset one of the pointers to the head of the list.
                ListNode entry = head;

                // Move both entry and slow pointers until they meet at the cycle's starting node.
                while (entry != slow) {
                    entry = entry.next;
                    slow = slow.next;
                }

                // Return the node where the entry and slow pointers meet, which is the cycle's starting node.
                return entry;
            }
        }

        // If the loop completes without finding a cycle, return null to indicate no cycle.
        return null;
    }
}
