## Problem statement:

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, both of length `n`, consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can apply the following operation on any of the two strings any number of times:

Choose any two indices `i` and `j` such that `i < j` and the difference `j - i` is even, then swap the two characters at those indices in the string.
Return true if you can make the strings `s1` and `s2` equal, and false otherwise.


## Example 1:

```
Input: s1 = "abcdba", s2 = "cabdab"

Output: true

Explanation: We can apply the following operations on s1:
- Choose the indices i = 0, j = 2. The resulting string is s1 = "cbadba".
- Choose the indices i = 2, j = 4. The resulting string is s1 = "cbbdaa".
- Choose the indices i = 1, j = 5. The resulting string is s1 = "cabdab" = s2.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s1 = "abe", s2 = "bea"

Output: false

Explanation: It is not possible to make the two strings equal.
```




## Constraints:

```
n == s1.length == s2.length

1 <= n <= 10^5

s1 and s2 consist only of lowercase English letters.
```


 

## Approach:
***The key intuition here is that if the counts of characters at odd and even positions match in both strings, it implies that the two strings can be made equal by swapping characters. Conversely, if the character counts don't match, the strings cannot be made equal.***

1. Initialize two arrays, `odd` and `even`, each of size 26, to count the occurrences of characters at odd and even positions.

2. Iterate through both input strings, `s1` and `s2`, character by character.

3. For each character in the strings, determine if its position is odd or even based on the index.

    - If the character is at an odd position:
        - Increment the count of that character in the `odd` array for `s1`.
        - Decrement the count of that character in the `odd` array for `s2`.
    
    - If the character is at an even position:
        - Increment the count of that character in the `even` array for `s1`.
        - Decrement the count of that character in the `even` array for `s2`.

4. After processing both strings, check if all character counts in both `odd` and `even` arrays are zero. If any count is not zero, return `false` because the two strings cannot be made equal by swapping characters.

5. If all character counts in both arrays are zero, return `true` because the two strings can be made equal by swapping characters at odd and even positions.



## Code: 

```java
public boolean checkStrings(String s1, String s2) {
    int[] odd = new int[26];  // An array to count characters at odd positions
    int[] even = new int[26]; // An array to count characters at even positions

    // Iterate through both strings character by character
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 1) {  // If the index is odd
            odd[s1.charAt(i) - 'a']++; // Increment the count of the character in odd positions of s1
            odd[s2.charAt(i) - 'a']--; // Decrement the count of the character in odd positions of s2
        } else {  // If the index is even
            even[s1.charAt(i) - 'a']++; // Increment the count of the character in even positions of s1
            even[s2.charAt(i) - 'a']--; // Decrement the count of the character in even positions of s2
        }
    }

    // Check if all character counts in both odd and even positions are zero
    for (int i = 0; i < odd.length; ++i) {
        if (odd[i] != 0 || even[i] != 0) {
            return false; // If any character count is not zero, the strings cannot be made equal
        }
    }

    return true; // If all character counts are zero, the strings can be made equal by swapping characters.
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N) 
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- In this question its not swapping in real but thinking it with indexes , swapping even-even index , odd-odd index
  not careing the rest , because if u think it themselves can interchange how they do we don't have to know just have tell
  true or false
