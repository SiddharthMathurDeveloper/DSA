## Problem statement:
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, both of length `4`, consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can apply the following operation on any of the two strings any number of times:

Choose any two indices `i` and `j` such that `j - i = 2`, then swap the two characters at those indices in the string.
Return `true` if you can make the strings `s1` and `s2` equal, and `false` otherwise.




## Example 1:

```
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"

Output: true

Explanation: We can do the following operations on s1:
- Choose the indices i = 0, j = 2. The resulting string is s1 = "cbad".
- Choose the indices i = 1, j = 3. The resulting string is s1 = "cdab" = s2.

```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dacb"

Output: false

Explanation: It is not possible to make the two strings equal.
```



## Constraints:

```
s1.length == s2.length == 4

s1 and s2 consist only of lowercase English letters.
```


 ***Can pick any string***

## Code: 

```java
public boolean canBeEqual(String s1, String s2) {
    // Convert s2 to a character array for easier character manipulation
    char[] s2CharArray = s2.toCharArray();

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        // Check if the characters at the current index of s1 and s2 are different
        if (i == 0 && s1.charAt(0) != s2CharArray[0]) {
            // If the first characters are different, swap the 1st and 3rd characters in s2
            swapCharacters(s2CharArray, 0, 2);
        } else if (i == 1 && s1.charAt(1) != s2CharArray[1]) {
            // If the second characters are different, swap the 2nd and 4th characters in s2
            swapCharacters(s2CharArray, 1, 3);
        }
        
        // Check if the characters at the current index of s1 and modified s2 are different
        if (s1.charAt(i) != s2CharArray[i]) {
            return false; // If different, return false, as they can't be made equal
        }
    }
    
    return true; // If all checks pass, return true, indicating that s1 and s2 can be made equal
}

// Helper function to swap characters in a character array
public void swapCharacters(char[] charArray, int index1, int index2) {
    char temp = charArray[index1];
    charArray[index1] = charArray[index2];
    charArray[index2] = temp;
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(N)
```

## Things I Learned:

- Observation , swapping that 0-2 and 1-3 can be used any of the string
