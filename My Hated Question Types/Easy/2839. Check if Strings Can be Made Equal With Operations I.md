## Problem statement:
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, both of length `4`, consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can apply the following operation on any of the two strings any number of times:

Choose any two indices `i` and `j` such that `j - i = 2`, then swap the two characters at those indices in the string.
Return `true` if you can make the strings `s1` and `s2` equal, and `false` otherwise.




## Example 1:

```
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"

Output: true

Explanation: We can do the following operations on s1:
- Choose the indices i = 0, j = 2. The resulting string is s1 = "cbad".
- Choose the indices i = 1, j = 3. The resulting string is s1 = "cdab" = s2.

```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dacb"

Output: false

Explanation: It is not possible to make the two strings equal.
```



## Constraints:

```
s1.length == s2.length == 4

s1 and s2 consist only of lowercase English letters.
```


 ***Can pick any string***

## Approach:

1. Iterate through both strings s1 and s2 simultaneously.

2. For each character at index i in both strings:

    a. If the characters are equal, continue to the next character.

    b. If the characters are different, we have two possible scenarios:

        i. If i is 0, swap the first character of s2 with the third character.

        ii. If i is 1, swap the second character of s2 with the fourth character.

    c. After performing these swaps, continue to compare characters.

3. After comparing all characters and performing at most two swaps, if s1 and s2 are equal, return true because we have successfully made s2 equal to s1 by at most two swaps.

4. If, at any point during the comparison, we find a pair of characters that cannot be made equal, return false because it's not possible to make s1 equal to s2 by at most two swaps.

## Example:

Let's consider an example to illustrate the approach:

Given s1 = "abcd" and s2 = "cbad".

**Step 1:** We iterate through both strings simultaneously:

    a. Compare 'a' (s1) with 'c' (s2). They are different.

    b. Since i = 0, we swap the first character of s2 with the third character. s2 becomes "bacd".

    c. Compare 'b' (s1) with 'a' (s2). They are different.

    d. Since i = 1, we swap the second character of s2 with the fourth character. s2 becomes "abcd".

**Step 2:** After these swaps, s1 and s2 are equal. So, we return true.

In this example, we were able to make s2 equal to s1 by performing at most two swaps, and hence, the function returns true.



## Code: 

```java
public boolean canBeEqual(String s1, String s2) {
    // Convert s2 to a character array for easier character manipulation
    char[] s2CharArray = s2.toCharArray();

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        // Check if the characters at the current index of s1 and s2 are different
        if (i == 0 && s1.charAt(0) != s2CharArray[0]) {
            // If the first characters are different, swap the 1st and 3rd characters in s2
            swapCharacters(s2CharArray, 0, 2);
        } else if (i == 1 && s1.charAt(1) != s2CharArray[1]) {
            // If the second characters are different, swap the 2nd and 4th characters in s2
            swapCharacters(s2CharArray, 1, 3);
        }
        
        // Check if the characters at the current index of s1 and modified s2 are different
        if (s1.charAt(i) != s2CharArray[i]) {
            return false; // If different, return false, as they can't be made equal
        }
    }
    
    return true; // If all checks pass, return true, indicating that s1 and s2 can be made equal
}

// Helper function to swap characters in a character array
public void swapCharacters(char[] charArray, int index1, int index2) {
    char temp = charArray[index1];
    charArray[index1] = charArray[index2];
    charArray[index2] = temp;
}
```
