Sliding Window (Fixed)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters ⭐ -> How to use Sliding window and in second approach how to avoid using hashmap [but here k is 3 (fixed)]
2269. Find the K-Beauty of a Number ⭐ -> How use Maths to group value together (using mod) / Numeric Sliding Window
643. Maximum Average Subarray I ⭐ -> Using max in double data type, how to round off , paying with double / rather than int
2379. Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks ⭐ -> minimum number of operations needed to least one occurrence of k consecutive elements / Algorithm to Find Minimum Count of element in Subarrays
1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold -> Averages
438. Find All Anagrams in a String ⭐ -> Avoiding travsel of hashMap instead using countSize to do the same to check every element in done
2461. Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K ⭐ -> How to only subract once on occurance if 1 element is there because that is only add not more than one because those are not added
239. Sliding Window Maximum ⭐ -> Using Deque to store , and how to use it [3,1](->) adding this way from last and remove from last to first [3,1] (<-)
219. Contains Duplicate II ⭐ -> These How is this kind of question can also be part of sliding window , Finding Duplicates Within K Distance
1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length -> Nothing ,Maximum Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

-----------------------------------------------------------
2024. Maximize the Confusion of an Exam ⭐⭐ -> Maximum Consecutive Answers ,Of only Two value ,that while can be used in sliding window (variable) , The Trick this question uses and how
1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element ⭐⭐ -> Longest Subarray with One Element Deletion
2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up ⭐ -> Calculating answer and remove element in the same loop , Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up
