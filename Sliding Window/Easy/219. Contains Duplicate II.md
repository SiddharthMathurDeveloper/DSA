## Problem statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, 
return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array 
such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3

Output: true
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1

Output: true
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2

Output: false
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
0 <= k <= 10^5

```


 

##  Approach (Best):


To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach with the help of a HashMap. The idea is to maintain a window of size k+1 and keep track of the frequency of each number within this window. If we encounter a number that already exists in the window with a frequency greater than or equal to 1, then we have found two distinct indices i and j such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

## Approach:

1. Initialize two pointers i and j to 0, which represent the start and end of the window, respectively.
2. Create a HashMap freqOfNums to store the frequency of numbers within the window.
3. Iterate through the array using the end pointer j:
   - Update the frequency of the current number nums[j] in the freqOfNums map.
   - If the frequency of nums[j] becomes 2, set isContainsDuplicate to true and break the loop, as we have found a duplicate within the window.
   - Move the window to the right by incrementing j.
4. If the size of the window (j - i + 1) becomes equal to k+1, slide the window to the right by incrementing i.
   - While sliding the window, decrease the frequency of the number at the start of the window by 1. If the frequency becomes 0, remove the number from the freqOfNums map.

## Example:

Let's take the first example to illustrate the approach:

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1], k = 3

Initially, the window [1, 2, 3] contains no duplicates. Then we slide the window to the right by adding the number 1 to the window. Now, the window becomes [2, 3, 1] and contains a duplicate (number 1). As abs(i - j) = 3 - 0 = 3, which is less than or equal to k = 3, the function should return true.





## Code: 

```java

public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
    // Create a HashMap to store the frequency of each number within a window
    Map<Integer, Integer> freqOfNums = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
    int i = 0; // Start of the window
    int j = 0; // End of the window

    int windowSize = k + 1; // Size of the window (k+1)

    boolean isContainsDuplicate = false; // Flag to indicate if the duplicate is found within the window

    while (j < nums.length) { // Loop through the array

        // Update the frequency of the current number in the window
        freqOfNums.put(nums[j], freqOfNums.getOrDefault(nums[j], 0) + 1);

        // If the frequency of the current number is 2, then we found a duplicate within the window
        if (freqOfNums.get(nums[j]) == 2) {
            isContainsDuplicate = true;
            break; // No need to continue, we found a duplicate
        }

        // Move the window to the right by incrementing the end pointer (j)
        j++;

        // If the window size exceeds the given value k, then slide the window to the right by incrementing the start pointer (i)
        if (j - i + 1 == windowSize) {
            int currentFreq = freqOfNums.get(nums[i]);

            // Decrease the frequency of the number at the start of the window by 1
            freqOfNums.put(nums[i], currentFreq - 1);

            // If the frequency becomes 0, remove the number from the HashMap to keep it updated
            if (freqOfNums.get(nums[i]) == 0) {
                freqOfNums.remove(nums[i]);
            }

            i++; // Move the start pointer to the right
        }
    }

    return isContainsDuplicate; // Return the result
}
```
