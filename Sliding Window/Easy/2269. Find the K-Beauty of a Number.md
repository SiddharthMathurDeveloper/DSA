<h1 align="center"><a href="" target="_blank">2269. Find the K-Beauty of a Number</a></h1>

## Problem statement:

The k-beauty of an integer `num` is defined as the number of substrings of num when it is read as a string that meet the following conditions:

It has a length of `k`.
It is a divisor of `num`.
Given integers `num` and `k`, return the k-beauty of `num`.

Note:

Leading zeros are allowed.
`0` is not a divisor of any value.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.


## Example 1:

```
Input: num = 240, k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "24" from "240": 24 is a divisor of 240.
- "40" from "240": 40 is a divisor of 240.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: num = 430043, k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: The following are the substrings of num of length k:
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
- "30" from "430043": 30 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "00" from "430043": 0 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "04" from "430043": 4 is not a divisor of 430043.
- "43" from "430043": 43 is a divisor of 430043.
Therefore, the k-beauty is 2.
```




## Constraints:

```
1 <= num <= 10^9
1 <= k <= num.length (taking num as a string)
```


 

## Approach - 1 :

1. Convert the integer `num` to a string representation to make it easier to process its substrings.
2. Calculate the number of digits in the integer `num`. This will help determine the length of the string representation.
3. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to keep track of the substring. The first pointer `i` will point to the start of the substring, and the second pointer `j` will point to the end of the substring.
4. Initialize a variable `result` to store the count of k-beauty substrings.
5. Initialize a `StringBuilder` named `formedStrings` to form substrings of length `k`. This `StringBuilder` will be used to build substrings by appending characters as we slide through the string.
6. Loop until the second pointer `j` reaches the end of the string:
   a. Append the character at the second pointer `j` to the `formedStrings` `StringBuilder` to form a new substring.
   b. Check if the substring's length is equal to `k`. If it is, this means we have formed a substring of length `k`.
      - Convert the substring to an integer `div` by parsing it from the `StringBuilder`.
      - Check if `div` is non-zero and `num` is divisible by `div`. If both conditions are met, it means the substring is a valid divisor of `num`, and we increment the `result` count.
   c. Remove the first character from the `formedStrings` `StringBuilder` to slide the window and continue forming new substrings.
   d. Move the first pointer `i` one step forward.
   e. Move the second pointer `j` one step forward.
7. Return the final `result` count, which represents the k-beauty of `num`.




## Code: 

```java

public int divisorSubstrings(int num, int k) {
        // Convert the integer 'num' to a string representation
        String numsString = String.valueOf(num);

        // Calculate the number of digits in the integer 'num'
        int length = (int) (Math.log10(num) + 1);

        // Initialize two pointers i and j to keep track of the substring
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;

        // Initialize a variable to store the result count
        int result = 0;

        // Initialize a StringBuilder to form substrings of length k
        StringBuilder formedStrings = new StringBuilder();

        // Loop until the second pointer j reaches the end of the string
        while (j < length) {
            // Append the character at the second pointer to the StringBuilder
            formedStrings.append(numsString.charAt(j));

            // Check if the substring's length is equal to k
            if (j - i + 1 == k) {
                // Convert the substring to an integer 'div'
                int div = Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(formedStrings));

                // Check if 'div' is non-zero and 'num' is divisible by 'div'
                if (div != 0 && num % div == 0) {
                    result++; // Increment the result count if the conditions are met
                }

                // Remove the first character from the StringBuilder to slide the window
                formedStrings.deleteCharAt(0);

                // Move the first pointer one step forward
                i++;
            }

            // Move the second pointer one step forward
            j++;
        }

        // Return the final result count
        return result;
    }

```

## Approach - 2 (Better) :

**Input:**
- `num`: The integer for which we want to calculate the k-beauty.
- `k`: The length of the substrings to be considered.

**Output:**
- `countResult`: The count of substrings of length `k` that are valid divisors of `num`.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize variables:
   - `n`: A copy of `num`.
   - `mod`: The value of 10^k, used for calculating the remainder.
   - `countResult`: A variable to store the count of k-beauty substrings, initially set to 0.

2. Start a loop while `n` is greater than or equal to `mod / 10`.

while n >= mod / 10:


3. Calculate the remainder when `n` is divided by `mod`.


divisor = n % mod


4. Check if the `divisor` is non-zero and `num` is divisible by the `divisor`.

if divisor != 0 and num % divisor == 0:

- If the conditions are met, increment `countResult` by 1.

5. Remove the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10.



6. Repeat the process until the loop ends.

7. The loop ends when `n` becomes less than `mod / 10`.

8. Return the final `countResult`, which represents the k-beauty of `num`.

**Example:**

Input:
- `num = 430043`
- `k = 2`

Output:
- `countResult = 1` (represents the k-beauty of `num`)













## Code: 

```java
 public int divisorSubstrings(int num, int k) {
        // Copy the value of 'num' into a local variable 'n'
        int n = num;

        // Calculate the modulo value 'mod' using 10^k
        long mod = (long) Math.pow(10L, k);

        // Initialize a variable to store the result count
        int countResult = 0;

        // Loop until 'n' is greater than or equal to mod/10
        // This loop processes the digits of 'num' from right to left
        while (n >= mod / 10) {
            // Calculate the remainder when 'n' is divided by 'mod'
            long divisor = n % mod;

            // Check if the divisor is non-zero and 'num' is divisible by 'divisor'
            if (divisor != 0 && num % divisor == 0) {
                countResult++; // Increment the result count if the conditions are met
            }

            // Remove the last digit from 'n' by performing integer division by 10
            n /= 10;
        }

        // Return the final result count
        return countResult;
    }
```
