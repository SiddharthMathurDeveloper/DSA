<h1 align="center"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/substrings-of-size-three-with-distinct-characters/description/" target="_blank">1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters</a></h1>

## Problem statement:
A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string `s`​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.


## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "xyzzaz"

Output: 1

Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".

```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "aababcabc"

Output: 4

Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc"
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= s.length <= 100

s​​​​​​ consists of lowercase English letters.

```


 

## Optimization Approach - 1 [Using hashing]:

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to represent the left and right ends of the sliding window, respectively.
2. Initialize a `HashMap`, `uniqueElements`, to store the count of unique characters within the current window.
3. Initialize a variable, `totalGoodSubstrings`, to keep track of the count of good substrings found so far.
4. Set the required length of the substring, `k`, to 3.
5. Iterate through the string using the right pointer `j`, and do the following for each character:
   a. Add the current character at pointer `j` to the `HashMap` and update its count.
   b. Check if the length of the current window is equal to `k`.
   c. If the number of unique characters in the window is equal to `k`, increment `totalGoodSubstrings` as we have found a good substring of length three.
   d. Move the left pointer `i` to slide the window one step to the right:
      - Get the character at the left pointer and update its count in the `HashMap`.
      - If the count of the character becomes zero, remove it from the `HashMap`.
   e. Move the right pointer `j` to expand the window.

6. Return `totalGoodSubstrings` as the final result.



## Code: 

```java
public int countGoodSubstrings(String s) {
        // Create a HashMap to store the count of unique characters in the sliding window
        Map<Character, Integer> uniqueElements = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();

        // Initialize pointers i and j, and a variable to count total good substrings
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int totalGoodSubstrings = 0;

        // Define the required length of the substring (k = 3)
        int k = 3;

        // Iterate through the string using the right pointer j
        while (j < s.length()) {
            // Add the current character at pointer j to the HashMap and update its count
            uniqueElements.put(s.charAt(j), uniqueElements.getOrDefault(s.charAt(j), 0) + 1);

            // Check if the length of the current window is equal to k
            if (j - i + 1 == k) {
                // If the number of unique characters in the window is equal to k, it is a good substring
                if (uniqueElements.size() == 3) {
                    totalGoodSubstrings++;
                }

                // Move the left pointer i to slide the window one step to the right
                char currentCharacter = s.charAt(i);
                uniqueElements.put(currentCharacter, uniqueElements.get(currentCharacter) - 1);

                // If the count of the character at the left pointer becomes zero, remove it from the HashMap
                if (uniqueElements.get(currentCharacter) == 0) {
                    uniqueElements.remove(currentCharacter);
                }

                // Move the left pointer i to the right for the next window
                i++;
            }

            // Move the right pointer j to expand the window
            j++;
        }

        // Return the total count of good substrings
        return totalGoodSubstrings;
    }

```

## Optimization Approach - 2 [Without hashing]:

1. Initialize three characters `a`, `b`, and `c` to the first three characters of the string `s`.
2. Initialize a variable `res` to store the count of good substrings, initially set to 0.
3. Start iterating over the string `s` from index 3 to the second last character.
4. At each step, check if the current three characters (`a`, `b`, and `c`) form a good substring (i.e., all three characters are different).
   a. If the three characters form a good substring, increment the `res` variable.
5. After processing the substring ending at index `i`, slide the window one step forward by moving `a`, `b`, and `c` to their next positions in the string.
6. Finally, check if the last three characters (`a`, `b`, and `c`) form a good substring. If they do, increment the `res` variable.
7. Return the total count of good substrings (`res`) after processing the entire string `s`.



## Code: 

```java
public int countGoodSubstrings(String s) {
        // Check if the length of the input string is less than 3
        if (s.length() < 3)
            return 0;

        // Initialize three characters a, b, and c to the first three characters of the string
        char a = s.charAt(0), b = s.charAt(1), c = s.charAt(2);
        
        // Initialize a variable to store the count of good substrings
        int res = 0;

        // Loop through the string from index 3 to the second last character
        for (int i = 3; i <= s.length() - 1; i++) {
            // Check if the current three characters (a, b, c) form a good substring
            if (a != b && b != c && c != a)
                res++; // Increment the count if it's a good substring

            // Move the characters one step forward in the string
            a = b;
            b = c;
            c = s.charAt(i);
        }

        // Check if the last three characters (a, b, c) form a good substring
        if (a != b && b != c && c != a)
            res++; // Increment the count if it's a good substring

        // Return the total count of good substrings
        return res;
    }
