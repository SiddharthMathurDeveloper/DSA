## Problem statement:
You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than `10^-5` will be accepted.




## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4

Output: 12.75000

Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [5], k = 1

Output: 5.00000
```


## Constraints:

```
n == nums.length
1 <= k <= n <= 10^5
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

```


 

## Approach (best):



1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to keep track of the window. `i` will be the left boundary, and `j` will be the right boundary of the window. Initially, both pointers point to the beginning of the array.

2. Initialize a variable `avgOfKElement` to keep track of the sum of the elements in the window. Add the elements in the window to this variable as we slide the window to the right.

3. Start a loop that runs until the right pointer `j` reaches the end of the array.

4. Inside the loop, add the current element (at index `j`) to `avgOfKElement`.

5. Check if the size of the window `(j - i + 1)` is equal to `k`. If it is, it means we have a valid window of size `k`. Calculate the average by dividing `avgOfKElement` by `k`.

6. Update `maxAverage` with the maximum value between the current `avgValue` and the previous `maxAverage`.

7. As the window moves to the right, subtract the leftmost element (at index `i`) from `avgOfKElement` to slide the window.

8. Move the left pointer `i` to the right (i++) to shrink the window for the next iteration.

9. Move the right pointer `j` to the right (j++) to expand the window for the next iteration.

10. Continue the loop until `j` reaches the end of the array.

11. After the loop ends, round off `maxAverage` to five decimal places and return the rounded-off value as the result.




## Code: 

```java
public double findMaxAverage(int[] nums, int k) {
    // Initialize the variable to store the maximum average found so far.
    double maxAverage = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;

    // Initialize two pointers to keep track of the sliding window.
    int i = 0; // Left pointer
    int j = 0; // Right pointer

    // Variable to keep track of the sum of k elements in the sliding window.
    double avgOfKElement = 0d;

    // Loop until the right pointer (j) reaches the end of the array.
    while (j < nums.length) {
        // Add the current element to the sum of the k elements.
        avgOfKElement += nums[j];

        // If the size of the sliding window reaches k, calculate the average and update the maxAverage if needed.
        if (j - i + 1 == k) {
            double avgValue = avgOfKElement / (double) k; // Calculate the average of k elements.

            maxAverage = Math.max(avgValue, maxAverage); // Update maxAverage with the maximum value found so far.

            avgOfKElement -= nums[i]; // Subtract the leftmost element from the sum as we slide the window.
            i++; // Move the left pointer to the right to shrink the window.
        }

        j++; // Move the right pointer to the right to expand the window.
    }

    // Round off the maxAverage to five decimal places.
    double roundOffValue = Math.round(maxAverage * 100000.0) / 100000.0;

    // Return the rounded off maxAverage as the final result.
    return roundOffValue;
}

## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

-  Using max in double data type, how to round off , paying with double / rather than int
