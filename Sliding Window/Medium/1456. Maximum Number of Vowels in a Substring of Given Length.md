## Problem statement:
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of `s` with length `k`.

Vowel letters in English are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.




## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3

Output: 3

Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "aeiou", k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5

s consists of lowercase English letters.

1 <= k <= s.length
```


 

## Approach (Best):

The given problem can be solved using the sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window of length k and keep track of the count of vowels within the window. We will slide the window to the right and update the count accordingly. The answer will be the maximum count of vowels found in any substring of length k.

## Approach:

1. Initialize two pointers i and j to 0, representing the start and end of the window, respectively.
2. Initialize two variables `maxVowels` and `vowelsCountInCurrentSubarray` to 0:
   - `maxVowels`: It will store the maximum count of vowels found in any substring of length k.
   - `vowelsCountInCurrentSubarray`: It will keep track of the number of vowels within the current window.
3. Create a HashMap `findVowels` to store vowels. Initialize it using the `addVowelsInHashMap` function (implementation not provided).
4. Iterate through the string `s` using the end pointer j:
   - If the character at j is a vowel (i.e., it is present in the `findVowels` HashMap), increment the `vowelsCountInCurrentSubarray`.
   - When the window size (j - i + 1) becomes equal to k, we update the `maxVowels` as the maximum of its current value and the count of vowels in the current window (`vowelsCountInCurrentSubarray`).
   - If the character at i (start of the window) is a vowel, decrement the `vowelsCountInCurrentSubarray`.
   - Move the start of the window i to the right.
   - Move the end of the window j to the right.
5. After iterating through the entire string `s`, the `maxVowels` will contain the maximum count of vowels found in any substring of length k. Return `maxVowels` as the result.

## Example:

Let's take the first example to illustrate the approach:

Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3

Initially, the window [a] contains one vowel ('a'). We slide the window to the right, and now the window becomes [ab], containing one vowel ('a'). We continue to slide the window, and now it becomes [abc], containing one vowel ('a'). We continue to slide the window, and now it becomes [bc], containing zero vowels. The window size has reached k = 3. We update the `maxVowels` as 1 (count of vowels in the current window).

We slide the window further to the right, and it becomes [cii], containing two vowels ('i'). The count of vowels in the current window is 2. We update the `maxVowels` as 2.

Finally, we slide the window one more time to the right, and it becomes [iii], containing three vowels ('i'). The count of vowels in the current window is 3. We update the `maxVowels` as 3.

After iterating through the entire string `s`, the `maxVowels` will contain the maximum count of vowels found in any substring of length k. In this case, it is `maxVowels = 3`. So, the function should return 3 as the result.

Output: 3




## Code: 

```java
public int maxVowels(String s, int k) {
        // Create a HashMap to store vowels
        Map<Character, Integer> findVowels = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        addVowelsInHashMap(findVowels);

        int maxVowels = 0; // Variable to store the maximum count of vowels found in a subarray
        int vowelsCountInCurrentSubarray = 0; // Variable to count the vowels in the current window

        int windowSize = k; // Size of the window (k)

        int i = 0; // Start of the window
        int j = 0; // End of the window

        while (j < s.length()) {
            if (findVowels.containsKey(s.charAt(j))) {
                vowelsCountInCurrentSubarray++; // Increment the count of vowels if the character at 'j' is a vowel
            }

            if (j - i + 1 == windowSize) {
                // Update the maximum count of vowels found in a subarray
                maxVowels = Math.max(vowelsCountInCurrentSubarray, maxVowels);

                if (findVowels.containsKey(s.charAt(i))) {
                    vowelsCountInCurrentSubarray--; // Decrement the count of vowels if the character at 'i' is a vowel
                }
                i++; // Move the start of the window to the right
            }

            j++; // Move the end of the window to the right
        }

        return maxVowels; // Return the maximum count of vowels found in a subarray
}

public void addVowelsInHashMap(Map<Character, Integer> map) {
        // Add vowels to the HashMap
        map.put('a', 1);
        map.put('e', 1);
        map.put('i', 1);
        map.put('o', 1);
        map.put('u', 1);
}
