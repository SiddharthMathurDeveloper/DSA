## Problem statement:
The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

For example, `"ACGAATTCCG"` is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string `s` that represents a DNA sequence, return all the `10`-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.



## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"

Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
```

## Constraints:

```
1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.
```


 

##  Approach (Best):

To solve this problem, we will use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a window of size 10 and slide it through the DNA sequence. For each window, we will keep track of the frequency of DNA sequences of length 10 using a HashMap.


1. Initialize two pointers i and j at the beginning of the sequence.
2. Create an empty HashMap `sequenceFrequency` to store the frequency of DNA sequences.
3. Create an empty list `repeatedSequences` to store the sequences that occur more than once.
4. Iterate through the DNA sequence using pointer j:
   - Append the character at position j to a StringBuilder to form a 10-letter DNA sequence.
   - If the size of the StringBuilder becomes 10, analyze the sequence within the window:
     - Convert the StringBuilder to a string representing the DNA sequence.
     - If this sequence is not present in the `sequenceFrequency` HashMap, add it with a frequency of 1.
     - If it is already present, increment its frequency.
     - If the frequency becomes 2, add the sequence to the `repeatedSequences` list.
     - Remove the first character from the StringBuilder to maintain the window size.
     - Move pointer i to the right.
   - Move pointer j to the right.
5. After processing each window, return the `repeatedSequences` list containing the repeated DNA sequences.

## Example:

Let's consider the example `s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"`.

Initially, the window will contain the first 10 characters: "AAAAACCCCC". We add it to the `sequenceFrequency` HashMap with frequency 1.

As we slide the window to the right, the sequence becomes "AAAACCCCCA". It is not present in the HashMap, so we add it with frequency 1.

Continuing this process, we reach the window "AAACCCCCAA". Again, this sequence is not present in the HashMap, so we add it with frequency 1.

When we reach the window "AACCCCCAAA", the sequence "AAAACCCCCA" is already present in the HashMap with frequency 1. We increment its frequency to 2 and add it to the `repeatedSequences` list.

We continue this process until we have processed the entire sequence.

The list of repeated DNA sequences will be ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].

This approach efficiently finds the repeated DNA sequences by maintaining a sliding window and a HashMap to keep track of sequences and their frequencies.





## Code: 

```java
public List<String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {
    // Create a HashMap to store the frequency of each DNA sequence
    Map<String, Integer> repeatedDnaSequences = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
    List<String> repeatedSequences = new ArrayList<>();

    StringBuilder dnaSubarray = new StringBuilder(""); // StringBuilder to build the current DNA subarray

    int i = 0; // Start of the window
    int j = 0; // End of the window

    int windowSize = 10; // Size of the window

    while (j < s.length()) {
        dnaSubarray.append(s.charAt(j)); // Add the current character to the DNA subarray

        if (j - i + 1 == windowSize) {
            String sequence = dnaSubarray.toString(); // Convert the DNA subarray to a string
            repeatedDnaSequences.put(sequence, repeatedDnaSequences.getOrDefault(sequence, 0) + 1);

            if (repeatedDnaSequences.get(sequence) == 2) {
                repeatedSequences.add(sequence); // Add the sequence to the list of repeated sequences
            }

            dnaSubarray.deleteCharAt(0); // Remove the first character from the DNA subarray
            i++; // Move the start of the window to the right
        }
        j++; // Move the end of the window to the right
    }

    return repeatedSequences; // Return the list of repeated DNA sequences
}
