<h1 align="center"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element/" target="_blank">1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element</a></h1>

## Problem statement:
Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only `1`'s in the resulting array. Return `0` if there is no such subarray.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]

Output: 3

Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]

Output: 5

Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]

Output: 2

Explanation: You must delete one element.
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5

nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
```

## Code: 

```java
public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
    int i = 0; // Start of the window
    int j = 0; // End of the window

    int maxi = 0; // Variable to store the maximum length of subarray with at most one zero

    int zero = 0; // Variable to count the number of zeros encountered within the window

    while (j < nums.length) {
        if (nums[j] == 0) {
            zero++; // Increment the zero count if the current element is zero
        }

        // While there are more than one zeros within the window, shrink the window from the left (i)
        while (zero >= 2) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                zero--; // Decrement the zero count if the element at the start of the window is zero
            }
            i++; // Move the start of the window to the right
        }

        // Update the maximum length of subarray with at most one zero found so far
        maxi = Math.max(j - i + 1, maxi);

        j++; // Move the end of the window to the right
    }

    return maxi - 1; // Return the maximum length of subarray with at most one zero (subtract 1 as the problem requires excluding the zero)
}
