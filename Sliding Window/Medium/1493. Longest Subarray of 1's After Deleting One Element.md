<h1 align="center"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element/" target="_blank">1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element</a></h1>

## Problem statement:
Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only `1`'s in the resulting array. Return `0` if there is no such subarray.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]

Output: 3

Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]

Output: 5

Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]

Output: 2

Explanation: You must delete one element.
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5

nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
```


 

## Approach (Best):

The given problem can be solved using the sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window of consecutive ones (i.e., a subarray containing only '1's) and keep track of the count of zeros encountered within the window. We will slide the window to the right and update the count accordingly. To find the longest subarray containing only '1's after deleting one element, we can allow at most one zero within the window. The answer will be the maximum size of the window encountered during the process.

## Approach:

1. Initialize two pointers i and j to 0, representing the start and end of the window, respectively.
2. Initialize two variables `maxi` and `zero` to 0:
   - `maxi`: It will store the maximum length of a subarray containing only '1's after deleting one element.
   - `zero`: It will keep track of the number of zeros encountered within the window.
3. Iterate through the binary array `nums` using the end pointer j:
   - If the element at j is 0, increment the `zero` count.
   - While there are more than one zeros within the window, shrink the window from the left (i) to satisfy the constraint of allowing at most one zero.
   - While shrinking the window, decrement the count of zeros if the element at the start of the window is 0.
   - Update the maximum length of the subarray containing only '1's after deleting one element (`maxi`) as the maximum of its current value and the window size (j - i + 1).
   - Move the end of the window j to the right.
4. After iterating through the entire binary array `nums`, `maxi` will contain the maximum length of the subarray containing only '1's after deleting one element. Return `maxi - 1` as the result (subtract 1 as the problem requires excluding the zero).

## Example:

Let's take the second example to illustrate the approach:

Input: nums = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

Initially, the window [0] contains one zero. We slide the window to the right, and now the window becomes [01], containing one zero and one '1'. We continue to slide the window, and now it becomes [011], containing one zero and two '1's. The count of zeros within the window exceeds one. To satisfy the constraint of allowing at most one zero, we shrink the window from the left, and it becomes [111]. Now, the window contains only '1's. We update the `maxi` as 3 (size of the window).

We continue this process, and the window becomes [1110], [11101], [111011], [1110111], [11101110]. The count of zeros within the window exceeds one. Again, to satisfy the constraint of allowing at most one zero, we shrink the window from the left, and it becomes [1101110]. Now, the window contains only '1's. We update the `maxi` as 5 (size of the window).

Finally, we slide the window one more time to the right, and it becomes [11011101]. The count of zeros within the window exceeds one again. To satisfy the constraint of allowing at most one zero, we shrink the window from the left, and it becomes [1011101]. Now, the window contains only '1's. We update the `maxi` as 7 (size of the window).

After iterating through the entire binary array `nums`, the maximum length of the subarray containing only '1's after deleting one element is `maxi = 7`. So, the function should return `maxi - 1 = 6` as the result.

Output: 6




## Code: 

```java
public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
    int i = 0; // Start of the window
    int j = 0; // End of the window

    int maxi = 0; // Variable to store the maximum length of subarray with at most one zero

    int zero = 0; // Variable to count the number of zeros encountered within the window

    while (j < nums.length) {
        if (nums[j] == 0) {
            zero++; // Increment the zero count if the current element is zero
        }

        // While there are more than one zeros within the window, shrink the window from the left (i)
        while (zero >= 2) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                zero--; // Decrement the zero count if the element at the start of the window is zero
            }
            i++; // Move the start of the window to the right
        }

        // Update the maximum length of subarray with at most one zero found so far
        maxi = Math.max(j - i + 1, maxi);

        j++; // Move the end of the window to the right
    }

    return maxi - 1; // Return the maximum length of subarray with at most one zero (subtract 1 as the problem requires excluding the zero)
}
