## Problem statement:
Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `threshold`, return the number of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to `threshold`.




## Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8], k = 3, threshold = 4

Output: 3

Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6 respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3], k = 3, threshold = 5

Output: 6

Explanation: The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
1 <= k <= arr.length
0 <= threshold <= 10^4
```


 

## Approach (Best):



1. **Initialize the following variables:**
   - `i`: Pointer for the start of the current subarray (set to 0 initially).
   - `j`: Pointer for the end of the current subarray (set to 0 initially).
   - `totalSum`: Variable to keep track of the sum of elements in the current subarray (set to 0 initially).
   - `ans`: Variable to store the count of subarrays that meet the threshold condition (set to 0 initially).

2. **Traverse the array with pointer `j` until it reaches the end of the array:**
   - Add the current element `arr[j]` to the `totalSum`.

3. **Check if the size of the current subarray (`j - i + 1`) is equal to `k`. If yes, proceed to the next step.**

4. **Calculate the `avgElement` by dividing `totalSum` by `k`. Since we are only interested in the integer part of the average, we don't need to use floating-point division.**

5. **Check if the `avgElement` is greater than or equal to the given `threshold`. If yes, increment the `ans` by 1 since this subarray meets the condition.**

6. **Subtract the first element `arr[i]` of the current subarray from `totalSum` to slide the window one step to the right. Increment `i` to move the start pointer to the right to consider the next subarray.**

7. **Increment `j` to move the end pointer to the right to expand the current subarray and continue the process.**

8. **Once the loop ends, return the `ans`, which will contain the count of subarrays that meet the threshold condition.**

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `arr`. This is because each element is visited once, and the while loop runs for a total of n iterations.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this approach is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space to store the variables `i`, `j`, `totalSum`, `ans`, and other intermediate calculations. The input array `arr` is not modified during the process.




## Code: 

```java

public int numOfSubarrays(int[] arr, int k, int threshold) {
        int i = 0; // Pointer for the start of the current subarray
        int j = 0; // Pointer for the end of the current subarray

        int arrLength = arr.length;
        int ans = 0; // Variable to store the number of subarrays that meet the threshold condition

        int totalSum = 0; // Variable to keep track of the sum of elements in the current subarray
        while (j < arrLength) {
            totalSum += arr[j]; // Add the current element to the total sum

            if (j - i + 1 == k) { // When the subarray size is equal to k
                int avgElement = (totalSum) / k; // Calculate the average of elements in the current subarray

                if (avgElement >= threshold) { // Check if the average meets the threshold condition
                    ans++; // Increment the count of subarrays that meet the threshold condition
                }

                totalSum -= arr[i]; // Remove the first element of the current subarray from the total sum

                i++; // Move the start pointer to the right to consider the next subarray
            }
            j++; // Move the end pointer to the right to expand the current subarray
        }

        return ans; // Return the total count of subarrays that meet the threshold condition
    }
