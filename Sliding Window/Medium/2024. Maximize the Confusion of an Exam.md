## Problem statement:
A teacher is writing a test with n true/false questions, with 'T' denoting true and 'F' denoting false. He wants to confuse the students by maximizing the number of consecutive questions with the same answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).

You are given a string answerKey, where answerKey[i] is the original answer to the ith question. In addition, you are given an integer k, the maximum number of times you may perform the following operation:

Change the answer key for any question to 'T' or 'F' (i.e., set answerKey[i] to 'T' or 'F').
Return the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after performing the operation at most k times.




## Example 1:

```
Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2

Output: 4

Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make answerKey = "TTTT".
There are four consecutive 'T's.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation: We can replace the first 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "FFFT".
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'T' with an 'F' to make answerKey = "TFFF".
In both cases, there are three consecutive 'F's.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1

Output: 5

Explanation: We can replace the first 'F' to make answerKey = "TTTTTFTT"
Alternatively, we can replace the second 'F' to make answerKey = "TTFTTTTT". 
In both cases, there are five consecutive 'T's.
```


## Constraints:

```
n == answerKey.length

1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4

answerKey[i] is either 'T' or 'F'

1 <= k <= n
```


 

## Approach (Best):

The given problem can be solved using a sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window of consecutive answers and keep track of the count of 'T' and 'F' characters encountered within the window. We will slide the window to the right and update the count accordingly. To maximize the consecutive answers, we can change at most k answers to the opposite value. The answer will be the maximum size of the window encountered during the process.

## Approach:

1. Initialize two pointers i and j to 0, representing the start and end of the window, respectively.
2. Initialize two variables countOfTrue and countOfFalse to 0, which will be used to track the count of 'T' and 'F' characters encountered within the window, respectively.
3. Initialize the variable ans to 0, which will store the maximum consecutive answers found so far.
4. Iterate through the answerKey using the end pointer j:
   - If the character at j is 'T', increment the countOfTrue.
   - If the character at j is 'F', increment the countOfFalse.
   - Check if the count of the less frequent answer (either 'T' or 'F') is greater than k.
   - If it is, we need to shrink the window from the left (i) to satisfy the constraint of changing at most k answers.
   - While shrinking the window, decrement the count of 'T' or 'F' characters at the start of the window (depending on the character at i).
   - Move the start of the window i to the right.
   - Update the answer ans as the maximum of its current value and the window size (j - i + 1).
   - Move the end of the window j to the right.
5. After iterating through the entire answerKey, ans will contain the maximum consecutive answers found within the constraint of changing at most k answers. Return ans as the result.

## Example:

Let's take an example to illustrate the approach:

Input: answerKey = "TFTFT", k = 1

Initially, the window [T] contains one 'T'. We slide the window to the right, and now the window becomes [TF], containing one 'T' and one 'F'. The count of the less frequent answer is min(countOfTrue, countOfFalse) = min(1, 1) = 1, which is not greater than k = 1. We update the answer ans as 2 (size of the window).

Next, we slide the window further to the right, and now the window becomes [TFT], containing two 'T's and one 'F'. The count of the less frequent answer is min(countOfTrue, countOfFalse) = min(2, 1) = 1, which is not greater than k = 1. We update the answer ans as 3 (size of the window).

Now, we slide the window again, and it becomes [TFTF], containing two 'T's and two 'F's. The count of the less frequent answer is min(countOfTrue, countOfFalse) = min(2, 2) = 2, which is greater than k = 1. We need to shrink the window from the left to satisfy the constraint. We move i to the right, and the window becomes [FTF], containing one 'T' and two 'F's. The count of the less frequent answer is min(countOfTrue, countOfFalse) = min(1, 2) = 1, which is not greater than k = 1. We update the answer ans as 3 (size of the window).

Finally, we slide the window to the right one last time, and now the window becomes [TFT], containing two 'T's and one 'F'. The count of the less frequent answer is min(countOfTrue, countOfFalse) = min(2, 1) = 1, which is not greater than k = 1. We update the answer ans as 3 (size of the window).

After iterating through the entire answerKey, the maximum consecutive answers found within the constraint of changing at most k = 1 answers is ans = 3. So, the function should return 3 as the result.

Output: 3



## Code: 

```java
    public int maxConsecutiveAnswers(String answerKey, int k) {
        int countOfTrue = 0; // Count of 'T' characters encountered in the window
        int countOfFalse = 0; // Count of 'F' characters encountered in the window

        int i = 0; // Start of the window
        int j = 0; // End of the window

        int answerKeyLength = answerKey.length(); // Length of the answerKey string

        int ans = 0; // Variable to store the maximum consecutive answers found

        while (j < answerKeyLength) {
            if (answerKey.charAt(j) == 'T') {
                countOfTrue++; // Increment countOfTrue if 'T' is encountered
            } else {
                countOfFalse++; // Increment countOfFalse if 'F' is encountered
            }

            // While the count of the less frequent answer (either 'T' or 'F') is greater than k, shrink the window from the left (i)
            while (Math.min(countOfFalse, countOfTrue) > k) {
                if (answerKey.charAt(i) == 'T') {
                    countOfTrue--; // Decrement countOfTrue if the character at the start of the window is 'T'
                } else {
                    countOfFalse--; // Decrement countOfFalse if the character at the start of the window is 'F'
                }
                i++; // Move the start of the window to the right
            }

            ans = Math.max(ans, j - i + 1); // Update the maximum consecutive answers found so far

            j++; // Move the end of the window to the right
        }

        return ans; // Return the result
    }
