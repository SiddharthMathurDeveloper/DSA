<h1 align="center"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-of-all-vowels-in-order/" target="_blank">1839. Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order</a></h1>

## Problem statement:
A string is considered beautiful if it satisfies the following conditions:

Each of the 5 English vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`) must appear at least once in it.
The letters must be sorted in alphabetical order (i.e. all `'a'`s before `'e'`s, all `'e'`s before `'i'`s, etc.).
For example, strings `"aeiou"` and `"aaaaaaeiiiioou"` are considered beautiful, but `"uaeio"`, `"aeoiu"`, and `"aaaeeeooo"` are not beautiful.

Given a string `word` consisting of English vowels, return the length of the longest beautiful substring of `word`. If no such substring exists, return `0`.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.


## Example 1:

```
Input: word = "aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu"

Output: 13

Explanation: The longest beautiful substring in word is "aaaaeiiiiouuu" of length 13.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: word = "aeeeiiiioooauuuaeiou"

Output: 5

Explanation: The longest beautiful substring in word is "aeiou" of length 5.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: word = "a"

Output: 0

Explanation: There is no beautiful substring, so return 0.
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= word.length <= 5 * 10^5

word consists of characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
```


 

## Approach (Best):

The problem requires finding the length of the longest beautiful substring in the given string `word`. A beautiful substring must satisfy two conditions: all five English vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') must appear at least once in it, and the letters must be sorted in alphabetical order.

We can use a sliding window approach to find the longest beautiful substring. We'll maintain a window that starts with the first vowel encountered and keeps expanding to the right as long as the letters are in alphabetical order. Once the window includes all five vowels, we update the maximum length of the beautiful substring.

## Example:

Let's take the first example to illustrate the approach:

Input: word = "aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu"

Initially, the window starts with the first vowel 'a'. We iterate through the string using two pointers i and j, where i is the start of the window and j is the end of the window.

- We encounter 'e', which is greater than 'a', so we continue expanding the window.
- We encounter 'i', which is greater than 'e', so we continue expanding the window.
- We encounter 'a', which is less than 'i', so we reset the window to start from the current vowel 'a' and reset the counter count to 1.
- We encounter 'a', which is the same as the previous vowel 'a', so we continue expanding the window.
- We encounter 'i', which is greater than 'a', so we continue expanding the window.
- We encounter 'o', which is greater than 'i', so we continue expanding the window.
- We encounter 'a', which is less than 'o', so we reset the window to start from the current vowel 'a' and reset the counter count to 1.
- ...

We continue this process, and the window becomes ['a', 'e', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'i', 'o', 'u']. At this point, we have encountered all five vowels in alphabetical order. The window size (j - i + 1) becomes equal to 8, so we update the max as 8 (the size of the current window).

Finally, the iteration reaches the end of the string. The maximum length of the beautiful substring encountered is 8.

Output: 8




## Code: 

```java
public int longestBeautifulSubstring(String word) {
    int max = 0; // Variable to store the length of the longest beautiful substring
    int count = 1; // Counter for consecutive letters in increasing order
    int i = 0; // Start of the substring window
    int j = 1; // End of the substring window

    while (j < word.length()) {
        // If the current letter is smaller than the previous one, reset the window to start from the current letter
        if (word.charAt(j) < word.charAt(j - 1)) {
            i = j;
            count = 1;
        } 
        // If the current letter is different from the previous one, increment the counter
        else if (word.charAt(j) != word.charAt(j - 1)) {
            count++;
        }

        // If the counter reaches 5 (a, e, i, o, u), update the maximum length of beautiful substring
        if (count == 5) {
            max = Math.max(max, j - i + 1);
        }
        
        j++; // Move the end of the window to the right
    }
    
    return max; // Return the length of the longest beautiful substring
}
```
