<h1 align="center"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-consecutive-cards-to-pick-up/" target="_blank">2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up</a></h1>

## Problem statement:
You are given an integer array `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the value of the `ith` card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value.

Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return `-1`.


## Example 1:

```
Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]

Output: 4

Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: cards = [1,0,5,3]

Output: -1

Explanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= cards.length <= 10^5
0 <= cards[i] <= 10^6

```

# Problem Solution -

The given problem can be solved using the sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window of consecutive cards and keep track of the frequency of each card within the window using a HashMap. We will slide the window to the right and update the frequency of cards accordingly. To find the minimum number of consecutive cards to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards, we can calculate the minimum size of the window during the process.

## Approach:

1. Initialize two pointers i and j to 0, representing the start and end of the window, respectively.
2. Initialize a HashMap `findDuplicates` to store the frequency of each card in the window.
3. Initialize a variable `minConsecutive` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which will store the minimum number of consecutive cards to pick up.
4. Iterate through the array `cards` using the end pointer j:
   - Update the frequency of the current card in the window using the `HashMap`.
   - While there are duplicate cards within the window, shrink the window from the left (i) to find the minimum size of the window containing a matching pair of cards.
   - Update the `minConsecutive` as the minimum of its current value and the size of the window (j - i + 1).
   - Move the start of the window to the right (i++) and update the frequency of the card if it becomes zero.
5. After iterating through the entire array `cards`, the `minConsecutive` will contain the minimum number of consecutive cards to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. Return `minConsecutive` as the result, or -1 if it remains `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, indicating that it is impossible to have matching cards.

## Example:

Let's take the first example to illustrate the approach:

Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]

Initially, the window [3] contains one card with value 3. We slide the window to the right, and now the window becomes [3,4], containing two distinct cards (3 and 4). We continue to slide the window, and now it becomes [3,4,2], containing three distinct cards (3, 4, and 2). We slide the window further, and now it becomes [3,4,2,3], containing three cards (3, 4, and 2) with one duplicate (3). The window size (j - i + 1) becomes equal to 4, so we update the `minConsecutive` as 4 (the size of the current window).

We continue this process, and the window becomes [4,2,3], [2,3,4], and [3,4,7]. The size of the window containing a matching pair of cards is as follows:

- [4,2,3]: Size 3, no matching pair.
- [2,3,4]: Size 3, no matching pair.
- [3,4,7]: Size 3, no matching pair.

The window size (j - i + 1) becomes equal to 3, so we update the `minConsecutive` as 3 (the size of the current window).

Finally, we slide the window one more time to the right, and it becomes [4,7]. The size of this window is 2, and it contains one matching pair (4). The window size (j - i + 1) becomes equal to 2, so we update the `minConsecutive` as 2 (the size of the current window).

After iterating through the entire array `cards`, the `minConsecutive` will contain the minimum number of consecutive cards to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. The function should return `minConsecutive = 2` as the result.

Output: 2




## Code: 

```java
public int minimumCardPickup(int[] cards) {
        // Create a HashMap to store the frequency of each card
        Map<Integer, Integer> findDuplicates = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();

        int i = 0; // Start of the window
        int j = 0; // End of the window

        int minConsecutive = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Variable to store the minimum consecutive cards to be picked up

        while (j < cards.length) {
            // Update the frequency of the current card in the window
            findDuplicates.put(cards[j], findDuplicates.getOrDefault(cards[j], 0) + 1);

            // While there are duplicate cards within the window, shrink the window from the left (i)
            while (findDuplicates.get(cards[j]) >= 2) {
                // Update the minimum consecutive cards to be picked up
                minConsecutive = Math.min(minConsecutive, j - i + 1);

                int currentFreq = findDuplicates.get(cards[i]);

                // Decrease the frequency of the card at the start of the window by 1
                findDuplicates.put(cards[i], currentFreq - 1);

                // If the frequency becomes 0, remove the card from the HashMap to keep it updated
                if (findDuplicates.get(cards[i]) == 0) {
                    findDuplicates.remove(cards[i]);
                }

                i++; // Move the start of the window to the right
            }

            j++; // Move the end of the window to the right
        }

        // Return the minimum consecutive cards to be picked up
        return minConsecutive == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minConsecutive;
    }
