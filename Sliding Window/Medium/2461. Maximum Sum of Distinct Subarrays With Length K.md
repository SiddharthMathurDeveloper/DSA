## Problem statement:
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays of `nums` that meet the following conditions:

The length of the subarray is `k`, and
All the elements of the subarray are distinct.
Return the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions. If no subarray meets the conditions, return 0.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3

Output: 15

Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3

Output: 0

Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.
```





## Constraints:

```
1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
```


 

## Approach (Best):

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, both pointing to the beginning of the array.
2. Create a HashMap called `map` to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window.
3. Initialize two variables, `sum` and `maxSum`, to 0. These variables will be used to track the sum of elements in the current window and the maximum sum of elements in any valid window, respectively.
4. While the right pointer `j` is within the bounds of the array:
   a. Increment the frequency of the element at index `j` in the `map`.
   b. If the frequency of the element at index `j` becomes 1 (i.e., it's the first occurrence in the current window), add it to the current sum `sum`.
   c. If the window size (`j - i + 1`) becomes equal to `k`, check if the current window contains `k` distinct elements:
      - If it does, update `maxSum` if the current `sum` is greater than `maxSum`.
   d. Move the left pointer `i` to shrink the window from the left:
      - Get the frequency of the element at the left pointer `i` from the `map`.
      - Decrement the frequency in the `map`.
      - If the frequency becomes 0 (i.e., the element is no longer in the window), remove it from the `map` and subtract it from the current `sum`.
   e. Move the right pointer `j` to expand the window to the right.
5. Repeat steps 4 until the right pointer `j` reaches the end of the array.
6. The variable `maxSum` will hold the result, which is the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k` with `k` distinct elements.

### Example:

Consider the input array `nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3]` and `k = 3`.

#### Step 1: Initialization
- `i = 0` (left pointer)
- `j = 0` (right pointer)
- `map = {}` (empty HashMap to track frequency of elements in the window)
- `sum = 0` (current sum of elements in the window)
- `maxSum = 0` (maximum sum of any subarray of size `k` with `k` distinct elements)

#### Step 2: Iteration
1. Move the right pointer `j`:
   - `j = 0`, `nums[j] = 1`, `map = {1:1}`, `sum = 1`, `maxSum = 0` (no action for `j - i + 1 == k`)

2. Move the right pointer `j`:
   - `j = 1`, `nums[j] = 2`, `map = {1:1, 2:1}`, `sum = 3`, `maxSum = 0` (no action for `j - i + 1 == k`)

3. Move the right pointer `j`:
   - `j = 2`, `nums[j] = 1`, `map = {1:2, 2:1}`, `sum = 4`, `maxSum = 0` (no action for `j - i + 1 == k`)

4. Move the right pointer `j`:
   - `j = 3`, `nums[j] = 3`, `map = {1:2, 2:1, 3:1}`, `sum = 7`, `maxSum = 0` (no action for `j - i + 1 == k`)

5. Move the right pointer `j`:
   - `j = 4`, `nums[j] = 4`, `map = {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1}`, `sum = 11`, `maxSum = 0` (no action for `j - i + 1 == k`)

6. Move the right pointer `j`:
   - `j = 5`, `nums[j] = 3`, `map = {1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:1}`, `sum = 14`, `maxSum = 14` (Window size is `k`, and `map.size() == k`, so update `maxSum`)

7. Move the left pointer `i`:
   - `i = 0`, `nums[i] = 1`, `map = {1:0, 2:1, 3:2, 4:1}`, `sum = 13`, `maxSum = 14` (Remove `nums[i] = 1` from the window and update `sum`)

8. Move the left pointer `i`:
   - `i = 1`, `nums[i] = 2`, `map = {1:0, 2:0, 3:2, 4:1}`, `sum = 11`, `maxSum = 14` (Remove `nums[i] = 2` from the window and update `sum`)

9. Move the right pointer `j`:
   - `j = 6` (end of array), the loop terminates.

#### Step 3: Conclusion
The maximum sum of any subarray of size `k = 3` with `k` distinct elements in the input array `nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3]` is `maxSum = 14`, which is achieved by the subarray `[3, 4, 3]`.





## Code: 

```java
class Solution {
    public long maximumSubarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Create a HashMap to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Pointers i and j will define the current window [i, j]
        int i = 0; // Start of the window
        int j = 0; // End of the window

        long sum = 0; // Variable to keep track of the sum of elements in the current window
        long maxSum = 0; // Variable to store the maximum sum of elements in any valid window

        // Iterate through the array while expanding the window from left to right (by moving j)
        while (j < nums.length) {
            // Increment the frequency of the current element in the map
            map.put(nums[j], map.getOrDefault(nums[j], 0) + 1);

            // If the frequency of the current element is 1, add it to the current sum
            if (map.get(nums[j]) == 1) {
                sum += nums[j];
            }

            // If the window size becomes equal to k, check if the window contains k distinct elements
            if (j - i + 1 == k) {
                if (map.size() == k) {
                    // If the current window contains k distinct elements, update maxSum if needed
                    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
                }

                // Move the left pointer (i) to shrink the window from the left
                int currentFrequency = map.get(nums[i]);
                map.put(nums[i], currentFrequency - 1);

                // If the frequency of the element at the left pointer becomes 0,
                // remove it from the map and subtract it from the current sum
                if (map.get(nums[i]) == 0) {
                    map.remove(nums[i]);
                    sum -= nums[i];
                }
                
                i++; // Move the left pointer to the right to create the next window
            }
            j++; // Move the right pointer to expand the window to the right
        }

        return maxSum; // Return the maximum sum of elements in any valid window
    }
}
```

## Things I Learned:

- How to only subract once on occurance if 1 element is there because that is only add not more than one because those are not added
