## Problem statement:
You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3

Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]

Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1

Output: [1]
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
1 <= k <= nums.length
```


 

## Approach (Best):
 - To solve this problem, we will use a sliding window approach along with a deque data structure. The idea is to maintain a deque that stores the indices of elements in the current window in a way that the maximum element of the window is always at the front of the deque.

- We will initialize a deque and an array to store the maximum elements in each window. We will also use two pointers, 'i' and 'j', to represent the left and right boundaries of the current window.

- We will process the array using the right pointer 'j' and do the following:

  1. Remove elements from the end of the deque that are smaller than the current element 'nums[j]'. This ensures that the maximum element remains at the front of the deque.
  2. Add the current element 'nums[j]' to the end of the deque.
  3. If the window size is equal to 'k', it means a valid window is formed. We will store the maximum element in the current window (i.e., the element at the front of the deque) in the result array at the corresponding index.
  4. If the element at the front of the deque is the element going out of the window (i.e., nums[i]), we remove it from the deque as it will not be part of the next window. We increment 'i' to move the left boundary of the window to the right for the next iteration.
- Finally, we return the result array containing the maximum elements for each window.


## Example
Input: nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7], k = 3

1. Initially, deque = [] and i = 0, j = 0
2. Process nums[0] = 1
   deque = [1], i = 0, j = 1, ans = []
3. Process nums[1] = 3
   deque = [3], i = 0, j = 2, ans = []
4. Process nums[2] = -1
   deque = [3, -1], i = 0, j = 3, ans = []
5. Process nums[3] = -3
   deque = [3, -1], i = 1, j = 4, ans = [3]
6. Process nums[4] = 5
   deque = [5], i = 2, j = 5, ans = [3, 3]
7. Process nums[5] = 3
   deque = [5, 3], i = 3, j = 6, ans = [3, 3, 5]
8. Process nums[6] = 6
   deque = [6], i = 4, j = 7, ans = [3, 3, 5, 5]
9. Process nums[7] = 7
   deque = [7], i = 5, j = 8, ans = [3, 3, 5, 5, 6]

Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6]

Explanation: The maximum element in each window of size 3 is as shown in the table.

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7




## Code: 

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Create a deque to store indices of elements in the sliding window.
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
        int numsLength = nums.length;

        // The result array to store the maximum elements in each window.
        int[] ans = new int[numsLength - k + 1]; // This gives the total number of windows.

        int i = 0; // Left pointer of the sliding window.
        int j = 0; // Right pointer of the sliding window.

        int ansIndex = 0; // Index for storing elements in the 'ans' array.

        // Loop through the array using the right pointer 'j'.
        while (j < numsLength) {
            // Remove elements from the end of the deque that are smaller than the current element 'nums[j]'.
            while (deque.size() > 0 && nums[j] > deque.peekLast()) {
                deque.removeLast();
            }

            // Add the current element 'nums[j]' to the end of the deque.
            deque.addLast(nums[j]);

            // If the window size is equal to 'k', it means a valid window is formed.
            if (j - i + 1 == k) {
                // Store the maximum element in the current window at the corresponding index in the 'ans' array.
                ans[ansIndex++] = deque.getFirst();

                // If the element at the front of the deque is the element going out of the window (i.e., nums[i]),
                // remove it from the deque as it will not be part of the next window.
                if (deque.getFirst() == nums[i]) {
                    deque.removeFirst();
                }
                i++; // Move the left pointer 'i' to the right for the next window.

            }

            j++; // Move the right pointer 'j' to the right for the next window.
        }

        return ans; // Return the array containing the maximum elements for each window.
    }
}
