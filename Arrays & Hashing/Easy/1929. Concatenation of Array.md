## Problem statement:
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, you want to create an array `ans` of length `2n` where `ans[i] == nums[i]` and `ans[i + n] == nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n` (0-indexed).

Specifically, `ans` is the concatenation of two `nums` arrays.

Return the array `ans`.

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]

Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]

Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2]]
- ans = [1,2,1,1,2,1]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,1]

Output: [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]

Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3]]
- ans = [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]
```




## Constraints:

```
n == nums.length

1 <= n <= 1000

1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
```


 

## Approach (Optimal) [ Single Loop ]:

1. Calculate the length of the input array `nums` and store it in a variable `numsLength`.

2. Create a new integer array `ans` with a size of `numsLength * 2` to store the concatenated result.

3. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the elements of the `nums` array.

4. Inside the loop, for each element at index `i` in `nums`:
    - Copy the current element to the corresponding position in the `ans` array at index `i`.
    - Copy the current element again, but this time to an offset index `numsLength + i` in the `ans` array. This effectively appends the element to the end of `ans`.

5. After the loop completes, the `ans` array will contain the concatenated result.

6. Return the `ans` array as the output of the method.

This approach efficiently creates a new array containing the concatenated elements of the input array `nums`. It uses a single loop to copy elements and ensures that the order of elements is preserved in the resulting array.

## Example:
```
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
```
- Calculate the length of nums:
numsLength = 3

- Create a new array ans with a size of 3 * 2 = 6 to store the concatenated result:
ans = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

- Start the loop:

   - For i = 0:
     - Copy `nums[0]` (which is 1) to `ans[0]`: `ans[0] = 1`
     - Copy `nums[0]` (1) again to `ans[3]` (offset index): `ans[3] = 1`
   
   - For i = 1:
     - Copy `nums[1]` (which is 2) to `ans[1]`: `ans[1] = 2`
     - Copy `nums[1]` (2) again to `ans[4]` (offset index): `ans[4] = 2`

   - For i = 2:
     - Copy `nums[2]` (which is 3) to `ans[2]`: `ans[2] = 3`
     - Copy `nums[2]` (3) again to `ans[5]` (offset index): `ans[5] = 3`

- The loop continues until all elements in `nums` have been processed, copying each element to `ans` and appending it at an offset index. 

- After the loop completes, the `ans` array will contain the concatenated result, with the elements from `nums` followed by the same elements again in the same order.

- Finally, the `ans` array is returned as the output of the method.
ans = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

This loop efficiently duplicates the elements from `nums` and appends them to the end of the `ans` array, effectively achieving the goal of concatenation.

## Code: 

```java
class Solution {
   
    // This is the main method that performs the concatenation.
    public int[] getConcatenation(int[] nums) {
        int numsLength = nums.length; // Get the length of the input array 'nums'.

        // Create a new integer array 'ans' with a length of 'numsLength * 2'.
        int[] ans = new int[numsLength * 2]; // This is to store the concatenated result.

        // Single Loop Solution: Iterate through the 'nums' array using a for loop.
        for (int i = 0; i < numsLength; i++) {
            int currentElement = nums[i]; // Get the current element at index 'i' in 'nums'.

            // Store the current element at the same index 'i' in the 'ans' array.
            ans[i] = nums[i];

            // Store the current element again, but this time at an offset index 'numsLength + i'
            // in the 'ans' array. This effectively appends the 'nums' array to itself.
            ans[numsLength + i] = nums[i];
        }

        // Return the 'ans' array, which contains the concatenated result.
        return ans;
    }
}
```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- In one loop putting to start and middle indexs that same place [numsLength + i] or [mid+1] formula
