## Problem statement:
You are given an integer array `nums`. The unique elements of an array are the elements that appear exactly once in the array.

Return the sum of all the unique elements of `nums`.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]

Output: 4

Explanation: The unique elements are [1,3], and the sum is 4.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]

Output: 0

Explanation: There are no unique elements, and the sum is 0.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: 15

Explanation: The unique elements are [1,2,3,4,5], and the sum is 15.
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 100

1 <= nums[i] <= 100
```



## Approach (Brute Force) [ Two Loops ]:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of unique elements and set it to 0.

2. Get the length of the input array `nums` and store it in a variable `numsLength`.

3. Iterate through the elements of the input array `nums` using a for loop with index `i`.

4. For each element at index `i`, calculate its count in the array and store it in `countOfCurrentNumber`. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to count the occurrences of the current element.

5. Start a nested loop using another for loop with index `j` to compare the current element `nums[i]` with all other elements in the array.

6. Inside the inner loop, if the current element `nums[j]` is equal to `countOfCurrentNumber`, increment the `count`.

7. If the count of the current element becomes 2 (indicating that it has appeared more than once) and the current element `nums[j]` is equal to the element at index `i` (`nums[i]`), subtract the element from `sum` to ensure it's not included in the sum of unique elements and break out of the inner loop.

8. After the inner loop completes, the `sum` will contain the sum of unique elements.

9. Return the value of `sum` as the final result.



## Code: 

```java
class Solution {
    // This method calculates the sum of unique elements in the input array 'nums'.
    public int sumOfUnique(int[] nums) {
        int sum = 0; // Initialize a variable 'sum' to store the sum of unique elements.
        int numsLength = nums.length; // Get the length of the input array 'nums'.

        for (int i = 0; i < numsLength; i++) {
            sum += nums[i]; // Add the current element 'nums[i]' to the 'sum'.

            int countOfCurrentNumber = nums[i]; // Store the current element in 'countOfCurrentNumber'.
            int count = 0; // Initialize a variable 'count' to count the occurrences of the current element.

            for (int j = 0; j < numsLength; j++) {
                // Check if the current element 'nums[j]' is equal to 'countOfCurrentNumber'.
                if (countOfCurrentNumber == nums[j]) {
                    count++; // If so, increment 'count'.
                }

                // If the current element 'nums[i]' appears more than once, subtract it from 'sum' and break the inner loop.
                if (count == 2 && nums[i] == nums[j]) {
                    sum -= nums[j]; // Subtract the element from 'sum'.
                    break; // Exit the inner loop.
                }
            }
        }

        return sum; // Return the sum of unique elements.
    }
}
```

## Example :

Suppose we have the input array `nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`.

- Initialize `sum` as 0.

- Iterate through the elements of `nums`:

  - When `i = 0`, `nums[i] = 1`. Since there are no duplicates of 1 in the array, add it to `sum`, so `sum = 1`.

  - When `i = 1`, `nums[i] = 2`. Count the occurrences of 2 in the array; there are two of them. Since count becomes 2 and `nums[j]` is equal to `nums[i]`, subtract `nums[j]` from `sum`. Now, `sum = 1 - 2 = -1`.

  - When `i = 2`, `nums[i] = 3`. There is only one 3 in the array, so add it to `sum`. Now, `sum = -1 + 3 = 2`.

  - When `i = 3`, `nums[i] = 2`. Since there is already a 2 encountered earlier, it's considered a duplicate. So, subtract `nums[j]` (which is also 2) from `sum`. Now, `sum = 2 - 2 = 0`.

  - When `i = 4`, `nums[i] = 4`. There is only one 4 in the array, so add it to `sum`. Now, `sum = 0 + 4 = 4`.

- Finally, return `sum`, which is 4.

So, for the input array `nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`, the code will return 4 as the sum of unique elements.
