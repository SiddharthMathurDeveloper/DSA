## Problem statement:
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the `ith` student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where `heights[i] != expected[i]`.


## Example 1:

```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]

Output: 3

Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]

Output: 5

Explanation:
heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices do not match.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: 0

Explanation:
heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices match.
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= heights.length <= 100

1 <= heights[i] <= 100
```


 

## Approach (Brute Force):

1. Get the length of the input array `heights` and store it in the variable `heightsLength`.

2. Create a new integer array `expected` as a copy of the `heights` array using `Arrays.copyOf`. This `expected` array will represent the expected order of heights.

3. Sort the `expected` array in ascending order using `Arrays.sort`. This step effectively represents the expected order of heights.

4. Initialize a variable `notEqualToExpected` to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of students whose heights are not in the expected order.

5. Iterate through the elements of the `heights` array using a for loop. In each iteration:

   - Compare the current height in the `heights` array with the corresponding height in the `expected` array.
   - If the heights are not equal, increment the `notEqualToExpected` count.

6. After the loop completes, the `notEqualToExpected` variable will contain the count of students whose heights do not match the expected order.

7. Return the `notEqualToExpected` count as the result.


## Example:
`heights = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

1. Get the length of the `heights` array: `heightsLength = 5`.

2. Create a copy of the `heights` array called `expected`: `expected = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

3. Sort the `expected` array in ascending order: `expected = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

4. Initialize a variable `notEqualToExpected` to 0.

5. Start iterating through the elements of `heights`:

   - For the first student (i = 0), compare `heights[0]` (which is 5) with `expected[0]` (which is 1). They are not equal, so increment `notEqualToExpected` to 1.

   - Continue this process for the remaining students.

6. After the loop completes, `notEqualToExpected` will be equal to 5 because all heights are out of order compared to the expected order. Therefore, the code will return 5 as the output, indicating that 5 students have heights that do not match the expected order.


## Code: 

```java
class Solution {
    // Method to calculate the number of students whose heights are not in the expected order
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        // Get the length of the 'heights' array
        int heightsLength = heights.length;
        
        // Create a copy of the 'heights' array called 'expected'
        int[] expected = Arrays.copyOf(heights, heightsLength);

        // Sort the 'expected' array in ascending order (nLogn operation)
        Arrays.sort(expected);

        // Initialize a variable to count the number of students whose heights are not in the expected order
        int notEqualToExpected = 0;
        
        // Compare each student's height in 'heights' with the corresponding height in 'expected'
        for (int i = 0; i < heightsLength; i++) {
            // If the heights are not equal, increment the count
            if (expected[i] != heights[i]) {
                notEqualToExpected++;
            }
        }

        // Return the count of students whose heights are not in the expected order
        return notEqualToExpected;
    }
}
```
