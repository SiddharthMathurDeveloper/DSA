## Problem statement:
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Output: true
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: false
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]

Output: true
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
```


 

## Approach (Brute Force): 

### Nested Loop Iteration:

- The code uses two nested for loops to iterate through the elements of the input array `nums`.
- The outer loop (controlled by variable `i`) starts from the beginning of the array and goes up to the second-to-last element.
- The inner loop (controlled by variable `j`) starts from the element next to the one pointed to by the outer loop and goes up to the last element.

### Element Comparison:

- Inside the inner loop, the code compares the elements at indices `i` and `j` using the condition `if (nums[j] == nums[i])`.

### Duplicate Check:

- If the elements at indices `i` and `j` are equal, it means a duplicate is found.
- The code immediately returns `true`, indicating that the input array contains at least one duplicate element.

### Result If No Duplicates Found:

- If the code completes both loops without finding any duplicates, it returns `false`, indicating that there are no duplicate elements in the input array.

This approach efficiently checks for duplicates in the array using nested loop iteration.


## Example :
`nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]`

### Nested Loop Iteration:

- The outer loop (controlled by variable `i`) starts with `i = 0` and goes up to `i = 2` (second-to-last element).
- The inner loop (controlled by variable `j`) starts with `j = 1` and goes up to `j = 3` (last element).

### Element Comparison:

- Inside the inner loop, the code compares the elements at `i` and `j`.
  - When `i = 0` and `j = 1`, it compares `nums[0]` (which is 1) and `nums[1]` (which is 2), and they are not equal.
  - When `i = 0` and `j = 2`, it compares `nums[0]` (which is 1) and `nums[2]` (which is 3), and they are not equal.
  - When `i = 0` and `j = 3`, it compares `nums[0]` (which is 1) and `nums[3]` (which is 1), and they are equal.

### Duplicate Check:

- A duplicate is found in the inner loop when `i = 0` and `j = 3`. Since a duplicate is found, the code returns `true`.

### Result:

- The code returns `true`, indicating that the input array `nums` contains at least one duplicate element.



## Code: 

```java
class Solution {
    // Brute Force Approach
    
    // Method to check if the input array contains duplicate elements
    public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        // Get the length of the input array
        int numsLength = nums.length;

        // Iterate through the array using two nested loops
        for (int i = 0; i < numsLength; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numsLength; j++) {
                // Compare elements at indices i and j
                if (nums[j] == nums[i]) {
                    // If a duplicate is found, return true
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        // If no duplicates are found, return false
        return false;
    }
}

```



## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N^2)
Space complexity: O(1)
```







## Approach (Optimial) : 

### Create a HashMap for Frequency:

- Create a HashMap called `freqOfNums` to store the frequency of each number in the input array.

### Iterate Through the Array:

- Use a for loop to iterate through the elements of the input array `nums`.

### Updating Frequency in HashMap:

- For each element in the array:
  - Get the current element as `currentElement`.
  - Use the `freqOfNums` HashMap to update the frequency of `currentElement`. If `currentElement` is not in the HashMap, it defaults to a frequency of 0 and then increments by 1.

### Duplicate Check:

- After updating the frequency, check if the frequency of `currentElement` in the HashMap is equal to 2.
  - If the frequency is 2, it means a duplicate is found in the array, so the code immediately returns `true`.

### Result If No Duplicates Found:

- If the code completes the loop without finding any duplicates, it returns `false`, indicating that there are no duplicate elements in the input array.

This approach efficiently checks for duplicates in the array using a HashMap to keep track of the frequency of elements.

## Example :



## Code: 

```java
class Solution {
    // Optimal Approach
    public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        // Get the length of the input array
        int numsLength = nums.length;

        // Create a HashMap to store the frequency of each number
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> freqOfNums = new HashMap<>();

        // Iterate through the elements of the input array
        for (int i = 0; i < numsLength; i++) {
            // Get the current element from the array
            int currentElement = nums[i];

            // Update the frequency of the current element in the HashMap
            // If it doesn't exist, use a default value of 0
            freqOfNums.put(currentElement, freqOfNums.getOrDefault(currentElement, 0) + 1);

            // Check if the frequency of the current element is 2
            // If so, a duplicate is found, so return true
            if (freqOfNums.get(currentElement) == 2) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        // If no duplicates are found, return false
        return false;
    }
}
```
