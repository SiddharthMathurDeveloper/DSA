# Array 
- 1929. Concatenation of Array ⭐️ -> In one loop putting to start and middle indexs that same place [numsLength + i] or [mid+1] formula

- 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array -> Nothing much

- Largest Element in Array -> Nothing much

- 1299. Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side ⭐️⭐️ -> Something thing backward help , Rather thinking from front thinking from backward ,hint is given -1 always in last element and from                                                                       elements right side not clearly visible but they are the hints

# Hashing
- 1051. Height Checker ⭐️⭐️ ->  Using Hashing using array form , Constraint plays a role ,Learning comparing a index with hashmap value for correct decerement and getting a answer
        
- 217. Contains Duplicate ⭐️ -> Using the Hashing to reduce the repetitive loop calcalution by storing it in hashmap the freq of numbers

- 1748. Sum of Unique Elements ⭐️ -> Using HashMap to hold elements frequency , can be used as HashSet , when a particular hints we have to reduce we reduce and when its goes over , then don't so only one time we calcaluted
