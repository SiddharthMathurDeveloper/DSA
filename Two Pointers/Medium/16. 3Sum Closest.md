## Problem statement:
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.


## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1

Output: 2

Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1

Output: 0

Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
```




## Constraints:

```
3 <= nums.length <= 500
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-10^4 <= target <= 10^4
```


 

## Optimization Approach:

To find the three integers in the `nums` array whose sum is closest to the `target`, we can use a two-pointers approach. The main idea is to sort the `nums` array in ascending order first, which will allow us to efficiently explore different triplets.

1. Sort the `nums` array in ascending order using `Arrays.sort(nums)`.

2. Initialize the variable `result` to store the closest sum to the `target`. To find a preliminary value for `result`, we can set it to the sum of the first three elements in the sorted array (`nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]`).

3. Loop through the `nums` array, considering each element as a potential first element of the triplet. Iterate from index 0 up to the last three elements (`length - 2`), as we need at least three elements to form a triplet.

4. For each element at index `i`, use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to explore the possible pairs within the remaining subarray. The `start` pointer is set to `i + 1`, and the `end` pointer is set to the last element of the array (`length - 1`).

5. Implement the two-pointers approach within a `while` loop. Calculate the sum of the current triplet: `currentSum = nums[i] + nums[start] + nums[end]`.

6. Compare `currentSum` with the `target`:

    - If `currentSum` is greater than the `target`, decrement the `end` pointer to reduce the sum.
    - If `currentSum` is less than or equal to the `target`, increment the `start` pointer to increase the sum.

7. After each iteration, check if the `currentSum` is closer to the `target` than the previous `result`. If it is, update the `result` variable with the value of `currentSum`.

8. Continue the two-pointers approach until `start` becomes greater than or equal to `end`.

9. Once the loop finishes, return the `result` variable, which holds the sum of the three integers closest to the `target`.




## Code: 

```java

public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
    // Initialize the variable 'result' to store the closest sum to the target.
    int result = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[nums.length - 1];
    
    // Sort the 'nums' array in ascending order to make use of two-pointers approach.
    Arrays.sort(nums);

    // Loop through the 'nums' array, but only up to the last three elements (length - 2).
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
        // Initialize 'start' and 'end' pointers for the two-pointers approach.
        int start = i + 1;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        
        // Implement two-pointers approach to find the closest sum to the target.
        while (start < end) {
            // Calculate the sum of the current triplet.
            int currentSum = nums[i] + nums[start] + nums[end];

            // If the current sum is greater than the target, move the 'end' pointer to reduce the sum.
            if (currentSum > target) {
                end--;
            }
            // If the current sum is less than or equal to the target, move the 'start' pointer to increase the sum.
            else {
                start++;
            }

            // Check if the current sum is closer to the target than the previous result.
            // If it is, update the 'result' variable with the current sum.
            if (Math.abs(currentSum - target) < Math.abs(result - target)) {
                result = currentSum;
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the closest sum to the target found during the loop.
    return result;
}
