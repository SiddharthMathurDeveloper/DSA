## Problem statement:
You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of `s` so that `t` becomes a subsequence of `s`.

A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.


## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "coaching", t = "coding"

Output: 4

Explanation: Append the characters "ding" to the end of s so that s = "coachingding".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("coachingding").
It can be shown that appending any 3 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abcde", t = "a"

Output: 0

Explanation: t is already a subsequence of s ("abcde").
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: s = "z", t = "abcde"

Output: 5

Explanation: Append the characters "abcde" to the end of s so that s = "zabcde".
Now, t is a subsequence of s ("zabcde").
It can be shown that appending any 4 characters to the end of s will never make t a subsequence.
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5

s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
```


 

## Optimization Approach:

- Make Two pointer `i`,`j` both point to start and run a While loop over the given strings (also) u can use for loop
  
- The job of ith is move over the s string and jth is to move over the t string
  
- So when j is equal to t length that whole string has to be appended,
  
- if not then only move jth (chacater at jth) when it is equal to element that ith ,and always move ith foward
  
- Finally return the length by  total length - distance of j  (t.length() - j) 



## Code: 

```java

 public int appendCharacters(String s, String t) {
        int i=0;
        int j=0;

        while(i<s.length() && j<s.length()){
            if(t.length()==j){
                break;
            }
            if(s.charAt(i)==t.charAt(j)){
                j++; 
            }
            i++;
            
        }

        return t.length() - j;
 }

```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- How to check if one element is there and then move pointer foward in search of next character only and only then maitaining the order
