<h1 align="center"><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/" target="_blank">2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers</a></h1>

## Problem statement:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `players`, where `players[i]` represents the ability of the `ith` player. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array trainers, where `trainers[j]` 
represents the training capacity of the `jth` trainer.

The `ith` player can match with the `jth` trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's training capacity. 
Additionally, the `ith` player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the `jth` trainer can be matched with at most one player.

Return the maximum number of matchings between players and trainers that satisfy these conditions.


## Example 1:

```
Input: players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8]

Output: 2

Explanation:
One of the ways we can form two matchings is as follows:
- players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 <= 8.
- players[1] can be matched with trainers[3] since 7 <= 8.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of matchings that can be formed.

```

## Example 2:

```
Input: players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10]

Output: 1

Explanation:
The trainer can be matched with any of the 3 players.
Each player can only be matched with one trainer, so the maximum answer is 1.
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= players.length, trainers.length <= 10^5

1 <= players[i], trainers[j] <= 10^9
```


 

## Optimization Approach:

- Sort both array because we want check if players and trainers follow the conditions given in the question as we want to maximuize it.
  
- We want to give and most lowest trainer to the player value that should be greater or equal and close to it to maximize the result
  rather than giving any value to any player . `players = [4,7,9]`, `trainers = [8,2,5,8] so don't 4 the 8 level 8 but the closes to is greater
  or equal that is 5 , do for all`
- Make Two pointer i and j and make them point start `i=0`, `j=0` and ans variable to hold the matched Pairs , Job of `i` is to move over player and 'j' over trainer
  
- Run a while loop if players at `ith` index is less than trainers at `jth` then trainers can't take that player so move j++ to next trainer
  
- If players is players and greater then that trainer then fine . `i++`, `j++`, `ans++` , we found the match so pair is formed both pointer foward



## Code: 

```java
public int matchPlayersAndTrainers(int[] players, int[] trainers) {
        Arrays.sort(players);
        Arrays.sort(trainers);

        int i=0;
        int j=0;

        int maxMatchMade=0;

        while(i<players.length && j<trainers.length ){
            if(players[i]>trainers[j]){
                j++;
            }
            else if(players[i]<=trainers[j]){
                maxMatchMade++;
                i++;
                j++;
            }
           
        }

        return maxMatchMade;
    }

```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity:  O( 2*(N*LogN) + N )
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- `a` ability is less than or equal to the `b` capacity and we have to maxiumn it and keep pair of these two , and Sorting is the most Optimization Apporach
