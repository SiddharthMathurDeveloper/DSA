Two Pointers with Same Direction: This technique involves using two pointers that move in the same direction through an array or string.
Example question: Given a sorted array, find if there are two numbers that add up to a target sum.



Two Pointers with Opposite Direction: This technique involves using two pointers that move in opposite directions through an array or string.
Example question: Given a sorted array, find a pair of elements whose sum is closest to a target value.


Two Pointers with Multiple Arrays/Lists: This technique involves using two pointers to traverse multiple arrays or lists simultaneously.
Example question: Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.


Two Pointers with Multiple Conditions: This technique involves using two pointers that track different conditions or properties in an array or string.
Example question: Given an array of integers, find two numbers whose sum is closest to zero.

Two Pointers with Binary Search: This technique combines the two-pointer approach with binary search.
Example question: Given a sorted array, find the index of a target value using binary search.


Two Pointers with Sliding Window: This technique involves using two pointers to maintain a sliding window over an array or string.
Example question: Given an array of integers and a target sum, find all contiguous subarrays that add up to the target sum.


Two Pointers with Counting: This technique utilizes two pointers to count occurrences or frequencies of elements in an array or string.
Example question: Given an array of integers, find the number of subarrays with a given sum.


Two Pointers with Backtracking: This technique combines the two-pointer approach with backtracking.
Example question: Given a set of numbers, find all possible combinations that sum up to a target value.
