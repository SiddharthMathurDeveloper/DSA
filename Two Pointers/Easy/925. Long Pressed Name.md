## Problem statement:
Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard. Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.


## Example 1:

```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"

Output: true

Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"

Output: false

Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleexa"

Output: false
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= name.length, typed.length <= 1000

name` and typed consist of only lowercase English letters.
```


 

## Optimization Approach:

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` to 0. `i` will be used to traverse the `name` string, and `j` will traverse the `typed` string.

2. Start iterating through the characters of the `typed` string while `j < n`, where `n` is the length of `typed`.

3. For each character at `typed[j]`, compare it with the character at `name[i]` if `i < m`, where `m` is the length of `name`.

   - If they are equal, move to the next character in the `name` string by incrementing `i`.

   - If they are not equal:

     - Check if the current character `typed[j]` is different from the previous character `typed[j - 1]`.

     - If it's the first character of `typed` (i.e., `j == 0`), or the current character is not equal to the previous one, then it means there's a mismatch, and we return `false`.

4. If we reach the end of the `typed` string, we need to ensure that all characters in the `name` string have been matched in the `typed` string. So, we check if `i` is equal to the length of `name`.

   - If `i == m`, it means all characters in `name` have been matched in `typed`, and we return `true`.

   - Otherwise, there are some characters left in `name` that have not been matched in `typed`, and we return `false`.




## Code: 

```java

public boolean isLongPressedName(String name, String typed) {
  // Initialize variables i, m, and n
    int i = 0, m = name.length(), n = typed.length();

   // Loop through the characters of 'typed' string
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)

      // Check if i is within bounds and the characters at i-th position in 'name' and 'typed' are equal
      if (i < m && name.charAt(i) == typed.charAt(j)) {
           // If they are equal, move to the next character in 'name'
              i++;
        }
        else if (j == 0 || typed.charAt(j) != typed.charAt(j - 1)) {
                // If they are not equal, check if the current character is different from the previous character in 'typed'
                // If it's the first character of 'typed' (j == 0), or the current character is not equal to the previous one,
                // then it means there's a mismatch, and we return false.
                return false;
            }

        // If we reached here, it means we have iterated through the entire 'typed' string
        // and checked all the characters in 'name'.
        // If 'i' is equal to the length of 'name', it means all characters in 'name' have been matched in 'typed'.
        // Otherwise, there are some characters left in 'name' that have not been matched, so we return false.
        return i == m;
}
