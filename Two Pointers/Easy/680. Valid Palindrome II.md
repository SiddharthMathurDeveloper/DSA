## Problem statement:
Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: true
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abca"
Output: true
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: false
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
```


 

## Optimization Approach:

- Make two pointer `i` and `j` , point `i=0` and `j=length-1` , then loop over the given string
  
- When we find the first mismatch character at `i` and `j` both character different , then we run 2 different version of that string , we make two different substrings `eg abaaacaa`
  
- The first substring is with removing last element from the mistmatch substring `eg-> baaaa` u see `c` is not included , we see if this is a valid palidrome or not
  
- The second substring is with removing first element from the mistmatch substring `eg-> aaaac` u see `b` is not included , we see if this is a valid palidrome or not

- If both are valid then fine or even one valid fine , this proves that by removing one element it is still a valid paildrome , but if two then not as max is one
  so either `baaaa` or `aaaac` in example not both ,then return false if both invalid , else true either one is valid

- When they are same move both pointer `i++` , `j--`

- If string is already a valid palindrome return true by default



## Code: 

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validPalindrome(String s) {
        // Initialize two pointers i and j to the start and end of the string s.
        int i = 0;
        int j = s.length() - 1;

        // Start a loop to compare characters from both ends until i is less than or equal to j.
        while (i <= j) {
            // If characters at positions i and j are not equal, there is a mismatch.
            if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)) {
                // Check if removing the character at position i or j results in a palindrome.
                boolean firstSubstring = validPalindromeSubstring(s, i + 1, j);
                boolean secondSubstring = validPalindromeSubstring(s, i, j - 1);

                // If either of the substrings is a palindrome, the overall string is a valid palindrome after removing a character.
                if (firstSubstring || secondSubstring) {
                    return true;
                } else {
                    // If neither of the substrings results in a palindrome, the original string is not a valid palindrome.
                    return false;
                }
            }
            // Move the pointers inward to continue comparing characters.
            i++;
            j--;
        }

        // If the loop completes without returning false, it means the whole string is a valid palindrome.
        return true;
    }

    // Helper method to check if a substring is a palindrome.
    public boolean validPalindromeSubstring(String s, int start, int end) {
        int i = start;
        int j = end;

        // Compare characters from start and end of the substring until i is less than or equal to j.
        while (i <= j) {
            // If characters at positions i and j are not equal, the substring is not a palindrome.
            if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)) {
                return false;
            }
            // Move the pointers inward to continue comparing characters.
            i++;
            j--;
        }

        // If the loop completes without returning false, the substring is a palindrome.
        return true;
    }
}
