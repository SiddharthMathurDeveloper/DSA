[ Two Pointer + String + Reversal ]
---------------------------------------

557. Reverse Words in a String III ⭐ [ Swapping trick ]
  -> Loop over the given String till that length(included) why because we also wnat last word , as if we didn't do it we won't get the last word to get processed in same loop 
      has we are getting word after ' ' empty char but in last word there is no empty char so, we do have the word/string but can't do in same loop in not to equal , a new loop must be created
  -> When we comes across ' ' we got the word reverse it and make word string again empty to get the new word move i++ to ignore ' ' move to next letter 
  -> When i==word we have the last word reverse it and return from there / or break and return 
  -> Keeping the letter adding to word expect ' 'empty
  -> To reverse a String just take first and last values and swap them
