## Problem statement:
Given an integer array `nums`, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return any array that satisfies this condition.



## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]

Output: [2,4,3,1]

Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0]

Output: [0]
```



## Constraints:

```
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
0 <= nums[i] <= 5000
```


 

## Optimization Approach:

- Move `i` foward in search of even and use `j` to be on odd when odd even match is found swap it then move `j` foward , `j` points on odd and `i` on even always
  
- Loop over the int array , start both pointer at the start `i=0`, `j=0`;
  
- Move right to find a even using the `ith` pointer and `j` point on the start index `jth` pointer towards odd number , So when we find number swap and do `j++` else always `i++`
  
- So , if we put even in it's place odd will be automatically get in there place
  
- working like this eg -> `[3,1,2,4]` `i=0 [3]`  `j=0 [j]` , it
  -  move foward 3 ignore for `i`
  -  move foward 1 ignore for `i`
  -  2 comes now swap 2 with `j` which is at 0 `j=0` [3] -> [2,1,3,4] and move `j++` and `j` again points to odd
     this works because odd is ignore by 2 so it passes over them so [3,2] after this [2,3] `j` now  points to 3 not 2 seet that
  - so on .... 
 
      


## Code: 

```java
public int[] sortArrayByParity(int[] nums) {
      
        int j=0; // make j pointer on start index j points on odd number

      
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){ // make i pointer on start index and then loop , and move i to search for even number
          
            if(nums[i]%2==0){   // when we find a even number
            
                   swapElements(nums,i,j); // we swap the values of i and j 
              
                    j++; // move j foward then 
            }
        }

        return nums;
    }

    // Function to swap the elements 
public void swapElements(int[] array, int index1, int index2) {
        int temp = array[index1]; 
        array[index1] = array[index2];
        array[index2] = temp;
}

```







## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- How to in optimize way swap elements and put in one side here(all even on left and odd right)
- for Loop instead of while
