## Problem statement:
You are given a string s consisting only of letters `'a'` and `'b'`. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.


## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ababa"

Output: 1

Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abb"

Output: 2

Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: s = "baabb"

Output: 2

Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either 'a' or 'b'.
```


 

## Optimization Approach:

- 
  
-

- 



## Code: 

```java
 public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        int sLength = s.length();
        int i=0;
        int j=sLength-1;

        while(i<j){
            if(s.charAt(i)!=s.charAt(j)){
                return 2;
            }

            i++;
            j--;
        }

        return 1;
    }

```


## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
```

## Things I Learned:

- If two letter are given how we can in  min moves we can make it palindromic
  


## Companies:

```
Bloomberg -> 2
```
