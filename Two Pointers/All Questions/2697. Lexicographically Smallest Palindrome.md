## Problem statement:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, and you are allowed to perform operations on it. In one operation, you can replace a character in s with another lowercase English letter.

Your task is to make s a palindrome with the minimum number of operations possible. If there are multiple palindromes that can be made using the minimum number of operations, make the lexicographically smallest one.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.

Return the resulting palindrome string.


## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "egcfe"

Output: "efcfe"

Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "egcfe" a palindrome is 1, and the lexicographically
smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is "efcfe", by changing 'g'.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: "abba"
Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "abcd" a palindrome is 2, and the lexicographically smallest
palindrome string we can get by modifying two characters is "abba".
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: s = "seven"
Output: "neven"
Explanation: The minimum number of operations to make "seven" a palindrome is 1, and the
lexicographically smallest palindrome string we can get by modifying one character is "neven".
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
```


 

## Optimization Approach:

- Make Two Pointer `i` and `j`, make `i` point on start `(i = 0)` and make `j` point on end `(j = length - 1)`.
 
- The approach is very simple: move `i` and `j` towards each other. When there is same character in `ith` and `jth` position then `i++`(move foward) , `j--` (move backward)
  
- If there is a mismatch then look which character is smaller character on left or right and convert the bigger one into , and then move both pointer according
  
- eg at `ith` there is `'b'` and `jth` there is `'a'` so `ith` becomes `a`  because `a` is smaller than `b`



## Code: 

```java

public String makeSmallestPalindrome(String s) {
        
        int i = 0; // Start this pointer from start

        int j= s.length()-1; // Start this pointer from end

        char[] charArr = s.toCharArray(); // convert to char Array to overwrite values

        while(i<=j){

            char startIndex = s.charAt(i); // Get character at ith element
            
            char endIndex = s.charAt(j); // Get character at jth element
            
            
              
              // Get Min char of i and j replace the greater value with small value in bid to make Lexicographically Smallest Palidrome
            if(startIndex>endIndex){ 
                charArr[i] = endIndex;
            }
            else if(startIndex<endIndex){
                charArr[j] = startIndex;
            }

            i++; // move i fowards
            j--; // move j backwards
        }


        return String.valueOf(charArr); // convert to string and return the ans
    }

```



## Complexity:

```
Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
```
