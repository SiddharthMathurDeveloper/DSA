## Problem statement:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: s = ["H"]
Output: ["H"]
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.

```

## Code: 

```java
 public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int i=0;
        int j=s.length-1;

      
        while(i<j){
            char leftValue = s[i];
            char rightValue = s[j];

            s[i] = rightValue;
            s[j] = leftValue;
            i++;
            j--;
        }

       return;
    }

```
