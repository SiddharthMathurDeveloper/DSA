## Problem statement:
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.


## Example 1:

```
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
```


## Constraints:

```
1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
```


 

## Optimization Approach:

- Loop over the given String , start both pointer at the start `i=0` , `j=0` , Make a String result for ans
  
- `i` pointer care about first string  , So keep checking if `i` is less than length becauase it is still within the index , then only append to Result STRING letter of `string1`
  
- `j` pointer care about second string  , So keep checking if `j` is less than length becauase it is still within the index , then only append to Result STRING letter of `string2`

- This works has `eg-> s1="ab"` , `s2="abc"` (vice-versa) so  `i` moves in front and simiulatoy `j` move but `i` stop it's append when it becomes==s1.Length but `j` contiues to append to result
  if `s1="abc"` , `s2="pqr"`  , so both are same they will keep append to result string has both are within bounds



## Code: Bigger version

```java
public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {

        int word1Length = word1.length(); 
        int word2Length = word2.length();

       StringBuilder mergedString = new StringBuilder();

        int i=0;
        int j=0;
       

        while(i<word1Length || j<word2Length){
            
            if(i>=word1Length){
                while(j<word2Length){
                     mergedString.append( word2.charAt(j) );
                     j++;
                }
                return mergedString.toString();
            }

             if(j>=word2Length){
                while(i<word1Length){
                    mergedString.append (word1.charAt(i) );
                    i++;
                }
                return mergedString.toString();
            }
            
            mergedString.append( word1.charAt(i) );
            mergedString.append( word2.charAt(j)  );
            i++;
            j++;
            

        }

        return mergedString.toString();
        
}

```

## Code: Smaller version

```java
 public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {

        int word1Length = word1.length();
        int word2Length = word2.length();

       StringBuilder mergedString = new StringBuilder();

        int i=0;
        int j=0;

        while(i<word1Length || j<word2Length){
            

            if(i < word1Length){ // till i is less than length 
                mergedString.append(word1.charAt(i));
                i++;
            }

            if(j<word2Length){ // till j is less than length 
                mergedString.append(word2.charAt(j));
                j++;
            }
        }

        return mergedString.toString();
}
```
