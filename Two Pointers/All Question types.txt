[ Two Pointer (Opposite Direction) ]
--------------------------------------------------
125. Valid Palindrome ⭐ -> How check Palindrome
680. Valid Palindrome II ⭐ -> The Approach
2697. Lexicographically Smallest Palindrome -> How to create a Lexicographically Smallest Palindrome
2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array -> How to find first Palindromic in array
1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences ⭐ -> If two letter are given how we can in min moves we can make it palindromic


344. Reverse String ⭐ -> Swapping Trick
557. Reverse Words in a String III ⭐ -> How to also get last word in the same loop
2000. Reverse Prefix of Word  -> Break in middle and do a reversal
345. Reverse Vowels of a String -> How to store a set of words in this case vowels using hashmap


942. DI String Match ⭐ -> How to construct a num array from Two character
977. Squares of a Sorted Array ⭐ -> Something a extra space won't hurt , don't always do inplace 


[Medium] --------------------------------------------------
1877. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array -> How to minimized maximum pair sum after optimally pairing up the elements
167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted ⭐ -> Finding two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number , provided they are sorted


[ Two Pointer (Same Direction) ]
--------------------------------------------------
1768. Merge Strings Alternately ⭐ -> How to move Alternately
905. Sort Array By Parity ⭐ [Maths] -> How to in optimize way swap elements and put in one side here(all even on left and odd right)


[Medium]--------------------------------------------------
2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign ⭐ -> Jumping Trick (odd/even) index
763. Partition Labels ⭐ -> How partition the string so that each letter appears in at most one part
2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence ⭐ -> How to check if one element is there and then move pointer foward in search of next character only and only then maitaining the order
2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers ⭐ -> a ability is less than or equal to the b capacity and we have to maxiumn it and keep pair of these two , and Sorting is the most Optimization Apporach
287. Find the Duplicate Number ⭐⭐ -> How Floyd's cycle detection algo / Fast slow pointer being used in here

                                                           



[ Three Pointer ]
--------------------------------------------------

[Medium]
75. Sort Colors ⭐⭐ -> Dutch National Flag Algorithm
15. 3Sum ⭐⭐ -> Point on move index and get element/required number using Two sum in Sorted array / Two sum is important question





[ Four Pointer ]
--------------------------------------------------
18. 4Sum ⭐⭐ -> Point on move index and get element/required number using Three sum in Sorted array / Two sum is important question [Four Sum = Three sum + Two Sum]
